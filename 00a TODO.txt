----------------------------
My WHY
----------------------------
Review this regularly!!

Its gonna be hard. When things are not going right, you need to find that spark or reason to 
keep perservering and pushing through. Remember your WHY!!

Pain of not having time with wife and family.
Pain of worrying about money.
Pain of being forced to work hard in a job with no end.
Pleasure of helping others around me.

Pain vs Pleasure
-------------------------------
Avoiding Pain/Fear is a FAR better motivator than Pleasure.
Its the pain or fear of being poor that will push you that extra mile a lot more than the 
potential pleasure for a great life 

When you are tired or uncomfortable its PAIN, or the fear and/or memory of 
PAIN that will drive you. 
Latch onto this - use it to your advantage!!

When you get stuck, lazy, or fearful, think of all the things you will lose by not taking action.
Really think deeply about it until you start to feel the pain that will occur by not taking action.


Goals - Visualize them!!
-----------------------------
Spend a moment thinking of the positive side of reaching your goals - imagine it in depth with feelings etc

Spend a moment thinking of the negative side of not reaching your goals - this is actually more 
important, since pain is a far better motivator than pleasure.


-------------------------------
RESEARCH AND/OR MEMORIZE
-------------------------------

Its not about who you know, its who knows you



Charging order in Wyoming/Nevada -if you get sued personally, you only have 1 llc (which owns the others)
creditors can only take what you take out of your wyoming/nevada llc, so just dont take money out and you
avoid creditors




I'm never buying a house conventionally, so I dont need a 30k reserve in my bank.
However, to qualify for a refinance, I need cash reserves - calculate this and keep that amount in my bank a
account perpetually so I dont need to keep "seasoning" my money....


15k at 10% a year = 1500 a year....

SCRIPT
---------------
Hello I'm calling about your house for sale at _____
I'm a local investor - id like to make a cash offer to buy your housse as is, and we 
can close whenever you are ready

-Make sure your dealing with the decision maker
Are you the home owner?

-What is the situation with the house
Why do you want to sell your house? (LISTEN)
people want to work with people who care (sometimes listen for half an hour)
listen for the sellers "hot buttons" that can help you
need money to move - have to sell by friday, dont wanna do repairs, has mold

-How much do you owe?
What do you owe on any subsequent mortgages
Do you have any tax liens or other liens that would need to be paid off that are tied to the house?

-What is the condition of the home?
How would you rate the house on a scale of 1 to 10 where 1 means it needs to be tore don, and 10
means its brand new and impeccable
Ask specifically about major items (roof, furnace, etc)

-What would you like to do with the house?
Listen - sell quickly, pay off slowly, etc

-Set Expectations
Motivated sellers will trade equity for peace of mind.
Help them understand the benefits of selling to an investor over listing w an agent
Cash, close quickly, as-is, cash for keys, help them move

-Set up a meeting/follow up
**If and only if the lead is promising (if not, give a verbal offer on the phone)
Be assertive - repeat back contact info and day and time for meeting/follow up
Be prepared to write offer on the spot



========================================
MAKE OFFERS!!! DONT BE LAZY
KEY TO 

========================================

What you offer to motivated sellers 

"Eqity for peace of mind"

Build A Connection
Be Transparent
Identify Their Motivation



---------------------
Lists to compile:
 eviction notices from court
 out of state landlords
 expired mls



MOTIVATED SELLERS
=============================
Your job is not to  "convince" someone why they should sell to you!
Its to "find" already motivated sellers (They may not be motivated now tho, just fyi)


Tips to talking to Motivated Sellers
=======================================
Explain what benefits you offer - (1 As Is, 2 Cash, 3 Close Fast)
Explain the diff between a retail buyer and you (What it would take for them to sell retail)


Tips on why/how to keep on following up with half-motivated sellers:

LOANS
=============
Fannie vs Freddie
 you can look up if your loan is with one of them online
 Freddie gives me better terms 85% LTV for a rate and term refi vs 75% from fannie - also no seasoning

For Fannie loans you can transfer to an llc after purchase?? But not freddie...
https://workshopmortgage.com/blog/blog/2018/04/26/fannie-mae-an-llc-now-real-estate-investors-can-have-both/

A single member llc mortgage counts against your 10 loans from fannie/freddie
However, if its a corporation that owns it, then it doesnt count...

 


Financing the purchase offer:
-----------------------------------
When I make offers on REOs on behalf of other investors who plan to use hard/private money, 
I make the offer the same way I would a cash offer (no financing contingency, etc), and then 
in the special stipulations, I indicate exactly how the buyer is purchasing the property 
(with private/hard money). I then include a letter from the lender indicating a pre-approval for the funds.

This way the offer looks good (no extra contingencies), but is completely transparent with the 
financing details. I never call it a "cash offer" (it's not), but don't complicate it with all 
the extra amendments and contingencies.

If the buyer gets the property under contract and has to fill out an addendum that asks for 
financing type, I will always indicate that the purchase is financed if the buyer is using 
private/hard money.

And I'll always include however much time is needed for financing approval into the due 
diligence period, so there is only one contingency in the contract, not multiple.

Doing it this way allow us to be completely honest and transparent, but still give us the 
best chance of getting the property under contract.

Credibility is super important








Multifamily documents
--------------------------------

a)Schedule E tax statements (if applicable)
b)Trailing 12 Profit/Loss
c)2015 and 2016 Monthly Profit/Loss
d)Personal property list
e)Inspection reports – any that have been done previously
f)6 months operating account bank statements
g)Current Lease Agreements*
h)5 Year insurance claims history (loss runs)
i)Current contracts—i.e.-landscape, management, trash, pest control, etc.
j)Full documentation of security deposit account
k)Property tax assessments
l)Current rent roll
m)Most recent 12 months of bills for water/sewer, gas, and electricity
a - depending on how the property is held, the seller may or may not have this

b & c - basically, I'm trying to piece together 3 years of financials, as this will give lenders greater comfort and give you and idea of any trends.

d - this is a list of the personal property that comes along with the asset: office computer, copier, leaf blower, etc.

e - some sellers may have surveys, Phase 1 Environmental, old appraisals, etc.  Not all do, but if they have them - especially the survey and Phase 1 - it makes your life a lot easier.

f - you want the bank account statements so you can compare them with the P&L.  Do the monthly deposits roughly match the monthly income reported?  What about expenses?  This will be tougher if the property doesn't have a dedicated operating account or if the seller comingles funds.

g - I like to see a sample lease up front, but the main point is that when you do your site visit you will audit ALL of the leases.  Very important.

h - this will tell you how many insurance claims have been paid in the last 5 years, what they were for, and how big they were.  This helps you get a more accurate insurance quote, and gives you an idea if you might have trouble getting insurance (or if there is a recurring issue you want to avoid).

i - the most important contracts are any you might be required to assume. The rest can be helpful in verifying expenses.

j - this is often on the rent roll, which should suffice. You just need to know how much is being held for tenant deposits, as this will be transferred to you at closing, and then you are liable to the tenants for it.

k - not only is it important to know for certain how the property is currently taxed, it's even more important to know how it might be reassessed after you buy it!

l - pretty self explanatory

m - this is another one I consider to be highly important.  Utilities can be one of your biggest expenses, and it is critical to verify actual billing against the P&L.  I once found a seller who was under reporting water on the P&L by $50,000 annually!

Few sellers will have all of this stuff, especially the smaller ones.  However, the more of it you can get the better off you will be and the less risk you will be taking of getting hit with a surprise down the road.

When do you ask for this? You of course need the T12 and rent roll to perform your initial analysis and make an offer. Most of the rest of it can be obtained during the due diligence period.

I hope this helps!
