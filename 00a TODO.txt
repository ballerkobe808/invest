General Investment Strategy and Processes
=================================================


Analyze every deal that comes thru email -
Add wholesaler to list if not already there




----------------------------
My WHY
----------------------------
Review this regularly!!

Its gonna be hard. When things are not going right, you need to find that spark or reason to 
keep perservering and pushing through. Remember your WHY!!

Pain of not having time with wife and family.
Pain of worrying about money.
Pain of being forced to work hard in a job with no end.
Pleasure of helping others around me.

Pain vs Pleasure
-------------------------------
Avoiding Pain/Fear is a FAR better motivator than Pleasure.
Its the pain or fear of being poor that will push you that extra mile a lot more than the 
potential pleasure for a great life 

When you are tired or uncomfortable its PAIN, or the fear and/or memory of 
PAIN that will drive you. 
Latch onto this - use it to your advantage!!

When you get stuck, lazy, or fearful, think of all the things you will lose by not taking action.
Really think deeply about it until you start to feel the pain that will occur by not taking action.


Goals - Visualize them!!
-----------------------------
Spend a moment thinking of the positive side of reaching your goals - imagine it in depth with feelings etc

Spend a moment thinking of the negative side of not reaching your goals - this is actually more 
important, since pain is a far better motivator than pleasure.


-------------------------------
RESEARCH AND/OR MEMORIZE
-------------------------------

Its not about who you know, its who knows you



Charging order in Wyoming/Nevada -if you get sued personally, you only have 1 llc (which owns the others)
creditors can only take what you take out of your wyoming/nevada llc, so just dont take money out and you
avoid creditors




I'm never buying a house conventionally, so I dont need a 30k reserve in my bank.
However, to qualify for a refinance, I need cash reserves - calculate this and keep that amount in my bank a
account perpetually so I dont need to keep "seasoning" my money....


15k at 10% a year = 1500 a year....

SCRIPT
---------------
Hello I'm calling about your house for sale at _____
I'm a local investor - id like to make a cash offer to buy your housse as is, and we 
can close whenever you are ready

-Make sure your dealing with the decision maker
Are you the home owner?

-What is the situation with the house
Why do you want to sell your house? (LISTEN)
people want to work with people who care (sometimes listen for half an hour)
listen for the sellers "hot buttons" that can help you
need money to move - have to sell by friday, dont wanna do repairs, has mold

-How much do you owe?
What do you owe on any subsequent mortgages
Do you have any tax liens or other liens that would need to be paid off that are tied to the house?

-What is the condition of the home?
How would you rate the house on a scale of 1 to 10 where 1 means it needs to be tore don, and 10
means its brand new and impeccable
Ask specifically about major items (roof, furnace, etc)

-What would you like to do with the house?
Listen - sell quickly, pay off slowly, etc

-Set Expectations
Motivated sellers will trade equity for peace of mind.
Help them understand the benefits of selling to an investor over listing w an agent
Cash, close quickly, as-is, cash for keys, help them move

-Set up a meeting/follow up
**If and only if the lead is promising (if not, give a verbal offer on the phone)
Be assertive - repeat back contact info and day and time for meeting/follow up
Be prepared to write offer on the spot



========================================
MAKE OFFERS!!! DONT BE LAZY
KEY TO 

========================================

What you offer to motivated sellers 

"Eqity for peace of mind"

Build A Connection
Be Transparent
Identify Their Motivation



---------------------
Lists to compile:
 eviction notices from court
 out of state landlords
 expired mls



MOTIVATED SELLERS
=============================
Your job is not to  "convince" someone why they should sell to you!
Its to "find" already motivated sellers (They may not be motivated now tho, just fyi)


Tips to talking to Motivated Sellers
=======================================
Explain what benefits you offer - (1 As Is, 2 Cash, 3 Close Fast)
Explain the diff between a retail buyer and you (What it would take for them to sell retail)

LOANS
=============
Fannie vs Freddie
 you can look up if your loan is with one of them online
 Freddie gives me better terms 85% LTV for a rate and term refi vs 75% from fannie - also no seasoning

For Fannie loans you can transfer to an llc after purchase?? But not freddie...
https://workshopmortgage.com/blog/blog/2018/04/26/fannie-mae-an-llc-now-real-estate-investors-can-have-both/

A single member llc mortgage counts against your 10 loans from fannie/freddie
However, if its a corporation that owns it, then it doesnt count...
