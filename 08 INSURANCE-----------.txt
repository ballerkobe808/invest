Insurance Types
===============================
1. Homeowner policy

In order to get a mortgage loan for your new home, you need to have a certain amount of hazard insurance 
included in your home insurance coverage. Hazard insurance is part of a homeowners insurance policy - 
it is not a separate coverage type. 
Read on to learn more about what hazard insurance covers and why it's important.

What is hazard insurance?
Hazard insurance and homeowners insurance are not separate coverage types. 
Hazard insurance generally refers to coverage for the structure of your home only. 
It may cover “hazards” such as fire damage, hail damage, theft, vandalism, and more. 
Other kinds of damage will be covered by other coverages within your home insurance policy. 
Hazard insurance doesn’t generally refer to the coverage that protects you for injuries incurred 
by you or your guests following an accident may be covered by liability coverage.

The reason ‘hazard insurance’ is a common term is actually because of lenders. 
Your mortgage loan provider may require hazard insurance at minimum before they will issue you a loan, 
because that is the only portion of the homeowners insurance policy directly related to the home structure itself. 
This may create the misconception that hazard coverage can be purchased separately from homeowners insurance, 
which is generally not accurate. If your lender has specified that you need hazard or dwelling coverage, 
just know that generally purchasing a homeowners policy will satisfy their requirements.

Red flags when deciding on a property from an Insurance perspective:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Any in-ground tanks (active or inactive)
2. Any Knob & Tube or Aluminum Wiring
3. If built before 1978, does the building have Lead Safe certifications
4. Any wood stoves or secondary heating units. If so, were permits pulled & were they installed by a professional
5. Are any of the homes rented to students
6. Is there a flat roof
7. Is there asbestos

The Year that the following were updated (either partially or fully) would be good to know:
- Heating systems
- Roof
- Plumbing
- electrical

Some companies will not write properties with systems that have not been updated.
If you are living there, the proper policy for a 1-4 family is a "Homeowners" policy. 
If the property is solely tenant occupied you will be looking for a Dwelling/Fire Policy 
(may be called a Landlord policy or similar name) or a commercial policy such as a Business-
owners or Package policy.






Homeowner Policy Sections (most will include these)
----------------------------------------------------------
1. Dwelling (Building coverage) The limit should be based on the Replacement Cost of the building 
(cost to rebuild with the same kind and quality excluding the foundation)

2. Contents (Personal Property): most homeowners policies give a set % of the Building limit for Contents. 
Dwelling/Fire policies requrie that you request a limit for conents.

3. Detached Structures: for other buildings on the property (ie. sheds & detached garages)
Again, there is normally an included limit of 10% of the building limit. That can be increased if needed.

4. Loss of Use / Loss of Rents: Normally, there is a 20% included limit. Loss of use is for your
additional expenses if you can not live there due to a covered claim (ie. Fire). 
The Loss of Rents is for the loss of your Rental income if tenants cannot occupy the house after a covered loss.

5. Personal Liability: For claims due to Bodily Injury or Property Damage that you Become Liable for 
and which is covered under the policy. Companies normally offer limits up to \$500,000 but some offer \$1,000,000. 
Buy the max.

6. Medical Payments: Provides coverage for an injury suffered on the premises. Does not require proof that 
you were at fault. Used to keep small loses into becoming lawsuits.Normally offered up to \$5,000 but
check to see if higher limits are available.

7. Deductible: This is not a coverage but rather your portion of a claim. Most better policies will not 
have a deductible for either the Liability or Medical payments coverage. 
It will apply to the other 4 coverages. You can select the amount of the deductible, usually ranges from
$500 to $5,000. The higher the deductible the lower your overall Premium but get quotes on all the 
deductibles you are interested in. Sometimes the incremental savings from $1,000 to $2,500 or from
$2,500 to $5,000 are too small to make the higher deductible worthwhile. \*\*\*depending on how far the 
house is from the coast, you may also be required to have a separate Wind or Hurricane deductible. 
Most times, the deductible will be 2% to 5% of the building value. 
That is a significant amount (on a \$500,000 building that comes to $10,000 for 2% or $25,000 for 5%).
A policy with a higher premium may be a better deal if it does not have a wind deductible.
Most of the better rates are from companies that write the Building coverage on a "Replacement Cost" (RC) basis.
It is a better coverage for the policy holder than "Actual Cash Value" (ACV).
A policy based on ACV will normally have a lower limit (ACV = RC minus depreciation).
RC is the cost to rebuild the structure with the same kind and quality.
In a market where rents are depressed, the RC will often be significantly higher than the ACV.
The problem with ACV is that, on a partial loss, the claim, under an ACV basis, has a deduction for depreciation.
You will have to kick in for the deductible and the depreciation.If your Rental is in good shape, updated
systems, well maintained, etc. the rates from some companies with only RC may be equivalent to others that 
will only do ACV.I just wrote one in CT that one of our carriers for $400,000 RC was $100 less than the next
best rate which was based on \$110,000 ACV for the same property. There are many endorsements that are 
available on the Homeowners policy. Without knowing the details I cannot suggest which would be
right to add on. Several you should pay attention to are:


- Ordinance & Law:
Provides additional building coverage to deal with rebuilding cost Increases due to changes in Zoning or 
Building laws

- Personal Injury Liability:
Libel, defamation of character, wrongful imprisonment, etc.
(normally recommended, especially if you are a landlord)

- Water Backup:
For water damage due to the backup of Sewers or Drains.

- Personal Articles:
Coverage for belongings that have a special or collectors value such as Jewelry, Furs, Fine Arts, 
Collectibles, etc... Depending on which company is being quoted, some of these other factors may get you credits:

Would you be able to give me a ballpark quote? Thank you!

Umbrella Liability policy instead of using an LLC
-------------------------------------------------------------
I always recommend investors do as many properties as they can under their personal name in the beginning 
(Fannie Mae allows up to 10) and then start going with the LLC's. If your concern is liability, 
get an umbrella liability policy. It's a lot cheaper money and the umbrella should give you adequate protection. 
If you're using any personal funds, unless their use and acquisition is documented properly, 
can take down the corporate veil and be porous. Even if you end up going the LLC route, I would 
consider an umbrella liability policy.


General Tips
=====================================
- Replacement cost on the roof??
Get renters insurace - $15 a month?

Vacant policy is more expensive than your normal policy
Can set it up as a normal policy as long as someone will get in there within 90 days

Can get it converted termporarily to a vacant policy if needed

Insurance companies - They will actually send someone out to look at it and request pictures
Builders risk - if its under 90 days, then dont need - if its gonna go too long, 
then flip it over to builders risk

DP1 - minimum amount to replace the loan
DP3 - replacement cost
