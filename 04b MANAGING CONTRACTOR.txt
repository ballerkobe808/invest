MANAGING A CONTRACTOR
-----------------------------

Contractor Lessons learned
Watch the vid from youtube for 7 rules again
1. Get 3 bids - 
2. Contra

Personal
1. Make a DETAILED scope of work - lot of work up front but worth it
2. Split up material costs and labor - possibly pay for materials yourself
2. Write up a detailed contract - including schedule, timline, and draws 
   with scope of work completed for next draw. Contractors normally are
   unorganized so the more organization and strucutre and expectaion you
   bring, the better. 
3. Include the contractor number, license, bond number, and insurance information.

2. Include appliances and hookup
3. Specify Flat paint ceilings - not popcorn, same with walls
4. Vinyl plank - you can even order from lowes yourself 


Make an agreement - Make Daniel Happy
If finished early or under budget, throw a bonus toward the contractor
If late, then late fees for each day/week late.




Did the contractor send you pics of the completed work? I always demand those before I pay anyone anymore. 
Learned that lesson the hard way from a contractor I had used successfully a few times before too.
