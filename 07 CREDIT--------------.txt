1. Personal Credit
-----------------------------------
Definition - "A numerical representation that you will become 90 days late within the next two years"
Important idea - "Good Credit is NOT just Not Bad Credit". Common misperception. You have to Build good credit.
There are a lot of ways to get your "credit score". Each lender will use a different criteria or calculation.
You don't actually have a "Credit Score". Its just a report that is calculated at that moment depending on a 
number of factors.

There will always be errors in your credit report - its interesing how they get data (look at ALL the data 
then take away everything that is definitely not you) - broken algorithm - research this.
last name, first initial - date of birth - ssn
Its often File Merge items vs identity theft that affect you...

Identify theft - most of the time its a relative, child, parents, etc. But when people get ahold of your 
account and make unauthorized charges, its often considered identity theft too. But its usually not 
"identity theft" - more "hacked accounts".
2 ways to view the world - live in fear constantly OR just monitor your accounts and just fix it when you 
find something odd/wrong. The latter is the way to go

### 5 Factors to your credit score:

1. Payment History 35% (193 points)

   - To show up on your report it must be 30 calendar days late (29 is fine). This doesn't apply to the actual 
     lender. If you are late there, they can change their terms/rates. Recency, Severity, and Frequency 
     all factor in.
   - 30 calendar days will take 9 months to recover
   - 60 calendar days late takes 3 years to recover.
   - 90 calendar days late takes 7 years to recover. This one is especially bad for you.
   - Charge off - when the company has written it off as a loss - it might have gone to a collection agency. 
     This is super bad. If you owe a collection agency - get a payment for delete written in writing.

2. Utilization Ratio / Indebtedness 30% (165 points)

   - Utilization Ratio: Non mortgage revolving lines of credt total (If coded correctly HELOC doesn't count, 
     but bank might have not coded correctly so be careful) divided by the total of the limits of them. 
     The number used is the balance on your monthly statement. So dont keep a high balance. This is the part 
     of your credit score you have the biggest ability to affect.
   - < 30 Good
   - 30-50 Neutral
   - > 50 Bad
   - 0 Not Great (Important to realize that zero balance is bad). So use ALL your cards at least once a month.
   - Strategy: pay down your balance to 1% 3-4 days before your credit date.
   - Average Age of file (all your cards) matters a lot too. 3-5 years u get respect, 5-10 is good, 10+ great
   - Consistency of Cards makes a difference too. If you have a lot open, dont close them, if you dont have 
     many open, dont keep opening new ones.

3. Age of File 15% (83 points)

   - Total Age of file
   - Average age of File

4. Mix of Credit 10% (55 points)

   - As many diff types of credit as possible. Suggestion is: 1 Mortgage, 2 Credit Cards, 2 Autmobiles, 
     1 Installment loan.

5. Inquries 10% (55 points)

   - Not important to credit report BUT important for approving of the loans
   - Soft Inquiry only appears to you, not to other lenders vs Hard Inquiry appears to others
   - The bank doesn't know if you got approved for a lot of credit recently, and if you were declined, 
     the bank will wonder why you were declined - basically increases the banks risks
   - Inquiry Windows (If you go shopping for mortgages, auto, student they all count as 1, but credit 
     cards are all counted separately)
   - 6 months - Banks will actively take a look at this
   - 1 year - How long they affect your credit score
   - 2 years - How long it stays on your report

### Summary of General Rules for great credit:

1. Pay your bills on time, including CC (auto pay CC)
2. Use all your CC a tiny bit once a month, but keep your balances low (pay off before they report)
3. Be aware of how opening and closing CC affect you...
4. Try to keep different (and many) types of credit
5. Different Banks look at different Credit Reports, in addition to hard inquiries
6. Inquiries are little blocks of credit gold - dont use them up unneccessarily
7. Check your scores to keep up to date: creditkarma.com - free!
8. 780 and 850 score is exactly the same (300-850)

### Credit Card Interest, Billing Cylce and Grace periods

In your CC Billing cycle you have a month's worth of charges that you can make and your CC Balance will 
slowly rise with each charge. At the end of the month (This just represents one month, but a month can be 
from jan 15-Feb 14 for example, not necssarily the 1st to the 31st), you will get a "Statement" of all the 
charges you made that month. This is different from your "Balance" which is all charges added up that you 
currently owe, including charges made after your "Statement" was calculated. The amount in the "Statement" 
will be due within the "Grace Period" - usually 21-25 days. If you pay the full amount then, you are charged 
nothing.

HOWEVER!!! If you don't pay the full statement amount (even leave 1 dollar), then you will be charged 
interest on the balance you have been holding this second month (during the grace period), including any 
charges made within the grace period instantly and retroactively. Be careful of this - every charge is 
accruing interest PER DAY here. Use 4.5% APR(or whatever your APR is) / 365 days to get the daily interest 
charged.

invoiced and use your credit to pay.

1. UPS Store (1.5k credit), Quill/Uline, Grainger (1k credit)

2. Staples, Sherwin Williams, Home Depot, JC Penny, Autozone, Macys, Budget, Office Depot (6k credit)

### Credit Cards ----

If it says Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American Express open it
Open as many credit cards as you can with no annual fee to have as much money available to you
(The guy had 10 hard inquiries and an 820 credit score)

You can do as many hard inquiries on a single day and not have it affect your credit???
