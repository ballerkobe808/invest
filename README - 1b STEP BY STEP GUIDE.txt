Researching a Property
============================================
Become an expert in Indiana - know all the neighborhoods and immerse yourself in this location -
Look thru maps and familiarize yourself with the streets, neighborhoods, news, business, crime, etc.
Get on Craigslist, Hotpads, Facebook and look through the area.

1. Open Rentometer and look the property up:
    https://www.rentometer.com/

2. Get the address and copy it into a text file:

3. Visit the Zillow comparables and look it up:
    https://www.homefixers.com/calculator.html
    (Find a way for a direct link?? https://www.zillow.com/homes/comps/1073669_zpid/)

4. Visit the Indiana Zone map and look it up:
    https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1ZJ6z2HR9cwVpc88QIQhmiRrwMg7-dW0H&ll=39.7676351552614%2C-85.95247823203124&z=11

    General Neighborhood information:
    https://www.biggerpockets.com/renewsblog/guide-grading-indianapolis-neighborhoods/

5. Look up the Crime Map stats on Trulia
    https://www.trulia.com   

5. Find the property tax for the previous year(s):
    Zillow
    Tax Accessor site:
    STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS TO GET TAX

    http://maps.indy.gov/AssessorPropertyCards/

    Then I like to look up the address and about a city block of that street in the enforcement and permit 
    database https://accela9ca.indy.gov/citizenaccess/ to get an idea of the problems in the area and outstanding 
    city issues with the home (these should be cleared up at closing.) Basically, if you have 2 homes on the 
    neighborhood that get investigated several times of the year for illegal dumping, abandoned vehicles, 
    vacant board orders, or high weeds/grass... it's probably a more distressed area.

6. Fill out the Investment Analyzer/Property Analyzer List

7. Walk the property on Google Maps:
    I also walk the street on Google Earth to ensure that I'm not across the street from a metal recycling 
    facility, railroad tracks, waste water treatment center, landfill, trucking warehouse, etc.

    Another interesting look is to use Google Maps to find all of the Starbucks in town. Draw a 3 mile circle 
    around all of them. Then look up all of the Pawn Shops, Check Cashing Places, and/or Payday Advance areas 
    and draw a circle around those as well. Commercial entities, like Starbucks, do much more research in areas 
    that we do. They target areas where people have extra money for luxury. Pawn shops and check cashing places 
    tend to be in neighborhoods where people struggle to pay their bills.

8. Additional Sites to view property:
    Redfin, Neighborhoodscout, Walkscore, Craigslist (for rents), Hotpads

9. Look up permits on county site

10. Get Insurance quote???

11. Title search - search for liens.
    Voluntary (mortgages, equity line of credit)
    Involuntary (Tax and Assessments, federal liens, judgement liens, vendor's liens, mechanic's liens)

12. Talk to a PM -
    After learning how to do some adequate pre-screening, a good PM can give you further insight, but we can't 
    go through lists of 30+ properties to do potential deal evaluations for all of our clients. You have to do 
    the initial work yourself, we do have a company to operate.

13. Boots on the ground insight -
    Lastly, have someone physically walk a street and count the number of apparent boarded up/distressed houses. 
    If there are more than 2 in the immediate area and more than 5 on a block (a decent PM can probably help 
    with this)... I typically recommend passing unless there are active rehabs going on at those homes.
