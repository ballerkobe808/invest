TRUSTS
================


Living Trust
----------------
Decides what to happen when people die - where the assets get divided
You make the plan or the government does it

No plan = Probate (Will doesnt count)
-------------------
  - private matters become public
  - court decides who receives assets
  - may take a long time (months or years)



Revocable - means you can ammend it
After the people on the trust die, you can no longer ammend, it becomes "irrovocable"


Make sure your LLC names a Trust (with your spouse etc), otherwise if you die, then assets
in your LLC may not go to her...
