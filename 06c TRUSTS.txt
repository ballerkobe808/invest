TRUSTS
================


Living Trust
----------------
Decides what to happen when people die - where the assets get divided
You make the plan or the government does it

No plan = Probate (Will doesnt count)
-------------------
  - private matters become public
  - court decides who receives assets
  - may take a long time (months or years)
