Cash out Refinance Process


==========================================
You can do a cash out refinance immediately for the purchase price.

If you want to cash out for more than the purchase price you need to:

1. Wait 6 months of seasoning to get a new appraisal
  You can start earlier and just close after 6 months
OR

2. Do the Andrew Postell method of own-LLC-refinance. Here are the steps:

1) Put a mortgage on the property when you buy (if multiple sources of money)
   OR
   Put a mortgage on the property after purchase.
2) This mortgage can be between you and your own LLC (Koala Investments)
   You need to do two things: Make a note (agreement between you and Koala Investments) about how much the loan 
   is for and the terms. In order to make it legitimate, then put realistic terms as far as interest (6%), 
   and amoritization (10-30 year), but make a balloon payment after 5 years. This will be the reason you want 
   to refinance out of it. The underwriters will ask less questions.
3) Talk to a lender about a mortgage refinance. Rules for a mortgage (no-cash) refinance are different  
   from a straight cash out refinance. The rules for the latter are a lot more lenient. I guess when a lender 
   is paying back another lender its different than giving the borrower cash. The "lenders" will want to talk 
   to each other about you soon. So you need an employee (spouse, friend, etc) or board member for them to 
   contact to vouch for the note agreement and to make sure you have been paying consistently.
4) You will need to submit all your documentation of income, taxes, assets, debt etc, as well as have your
   credit pulled. You will need to source any big deposits - remember and track this. I THINK you can use a 
   huge deposit be marked as a loan from Koala Investments...
5) The Lender will appraise the property (you will need to pay for this) - make sure to provide
   documentation for the lender to start with that states the case for your appraised value you are trying to 
   get. After the lender gets back the appraisal, you can also submit 3 comparables again for the appraiser 
   to re-evaluate - or give him/her some reason to adjust the property value.



Preparation Steps!!
=========================

1. Get Credit Score as High as possible
-------------------------------------------
Pay down Lines of credit by statement dates - this makes a big difference in your credit score
Pay down CC by statement dates
Don't take out new CC or make new Hard Inquries


2. Get the appropriate sourced money in an account 2 months prior 
------------------------------------------------------------------
Find the required seasoned amount, and store it in a bank account - you cant use borrowed funds.
Things you need this balance for:
  -Closing costs (lender can pay up to $2k from the loan), seller can pay up to 2%
  -Down payment (If doing a purchase)
  -Reserves for mortgage payment (6 months to be safe, some may say 2 months)
  -Reserves for any other mortgages you have (rent too???)


3. Prepare Documents and get them all organized
