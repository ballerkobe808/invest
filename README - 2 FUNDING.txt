Hello! My is Daniel, and I'm an investor from Hawaii looking to invest in an Indianapolis rental property. 
I'm planning to purchase a duplex for \$96,000. I'm looking for a 30 year fixed loan with an interest rate of 
5.5%. I can put down 20%. The following is a list of some of my information. Please take a look and tell me 
whether you have a program I would qualify for.

- I live out of state
- My credit score is 760
- My current DTI is 31%
- I will have \$40,000 in reserves after the down payment

If you don't have a program that I would qualify for, is there another institution you could recommend me to? 
Thank you very much for your time and consideration!

Daniel

Fill out the lenders application and get the prequalification letter.
This is helpful for the seller/realtor when you are buying so they know you are serious.
HOWEVER - Be careful because your credit will be pulled here - dont have it pulled unecessarily.


Questions to ask about the loan
-------------------------------------------
    1. What is the length and type of the loan? (30 yrs, 27, etc) (fixed, arm, etc)
    2. What is the rate? (APR%) (If variable, minx max)
    3. Origination Fee? Other fees?
    4. Any points up front to lower rate?
    5. Is there a pre-payment penalty?

Loan Points explanation:

Lender starts out at a base rate based on your credit score, assets, dti, current federal rates.

They will add points for different things:

- Non owner-occupied .5%
- Under 150k loan amount .25% (Under 75k even more??)
- Multifamily - .25%
- Others - 20% down???








Sources and Types of Funding
========================================
conventional bank/credit union loan,
portfolio bank loan,
hard money lenders (3-5 points, 12-15% interest),
friends/family/partners,
lines of credit (personal or home equity),
credit cards,
401k/IRA,
seller financing.

Line of Credit (HELOC, or Personal LOC)
---------------------------------------------
The key thing to note, is that an LOC's interest is calculated PER DAY.
You can get the daily interest by taking the APR (Example: 2.7%), dividing by 12 - to get the monthly interest, 
then dividing that by 30 to get the daily interest. (They do it like this vs dividing by 365 according to the 
renautus guys).

Most Local banks have personal line of credit products - shop around and talk to other investors

HElOC
-----------------------
HELOCs are Home Equity Lines of Credit. It is a line of credit against the equity in your property that is 
above the 20% amount. Lets use 20% as a base number - every bank will have their own products and criteria. 
You must always have at least 20% in equity in your property. Any equity over this 20% can be used as 
collateral for a line of credit against it. Example:

1. 100k home, with 20k of my money/equity. Since I'm at 20% and have nothing above the 20%, I cannot get a HELOC
2. 100k home, with 40k of my money/equity. Since I'm over the 20% threshold by 20k, I can get a HELOC for 20k
3. 100k home, with 80k of my money/equity. Since I'm over the 20% threshold by 60k, i can get a HELOC for 60k

These often come with low 1.7-2% introductory APRs for the first year. You can do strategic things here 
- Once the introductory rate is over, you can pay it off or cancel and open another HELOC with another bank lol.

One thing to note is that HELOC % is calculated by the day, so any balance used in a month will be 
charged interest. Credit Cards are charged at the end of the month. Use your Credit Card for daily 
purchases (you get points too) and only use your HELOC to pay off your CC as needed.

401k/IRA (Individual Retirement Account)
------------------------------------------
- Pretax dollars put here (so you get more bang for your buck)
- Reduces income tax (money contributed is not counted as income)
- Must be 60 to withdraw penalty free, otherwise 10% penalty
- Roth means you put in after tax dollars
- 401k - 18k limit as of 2017, IRA 5.5k limit as of 2017
- Compound interest is POWERFUL!!!

Datahouse 401k
------------------------
- Datahouse is matching 20% of your investment up to 2400. Its added as a lump sum once a year in July.
- You have been averaging 10% yearly returns from your mutual funds investment.
- You can stop any time, but open enrollment is Dec to change amounts (for Jan implementation)

Borrowing from your 401k
------------------------------------------
- You can borrow either 50% or 50k - whichever is less
- You have to pay back in 5 years unless its for a primary residence, or hardship, or special circumstance
- You will pay back interest but the interest all goes back to you
- If you quit or are fired, you have to pay it back in 60 days or incur a penalty
- Penalty for early withdrawal is 10%
- When you take it out for real, you pay income tax on it (Unless its a Roth)

Credit Cards
-----------------------
Always increase your limits given the chance. This helps you to lower your utilization % which helps your 
credit score, and also gives you access to more emergency funds should you need it.

Self-Directed IRA
------------------------


General Tips
--------------------------
Get as much funding as you can when possible. Its easier to take out 100k from the start, versus going for 
20k, 20k, 40k, 20k in succession. Cool story of borrowing money from your friend using both methods.



Cash out Refinance Process
==========================================
You can do a cash out refinance immediately for the purchase price.

If you want to cash out for more than the purchase price you need to:

1. Wait 6 months of seasoning to get a new appraisal

OR

2. Do the Andrew Postell method of own-LLC-refinance. Here are the steps:

1) Put a mortgage on the property when you buy (if multiple sources of money)
   OR
   Put a mortgage on the property after purchase.
2) This mortgage can be between you and your own LLC (Koala Investments)
   You need to do two things: Make a note (agreement between you and Koala Investments) about how much the loan 
   is for and the terms. In order to make it legitimate, then put realistic terms as far as interest (6%), 
   and amoritization (10-30 year), but make a balloon payment after 5 years. This will be the reason you want 
   to refinance out of it. The underwriters will ask less questions.
3) Talk to a lender about a mortgage refinance. Rules for a mortgage (no-cash) refinance are different  
   from a straight cash out refinance. The rules for the latter are a lot more lenient. I guess when a lender 
   is paying back another lender its different than giving the borrower cash. The "lenders" will want to talk 
   to each other about you soon. So you need an employee (spouse, friend, etc) or board member for them to 
   contact to vouch for the note agreement and to make sure you have been paying consistently.
4) You will need to submit all your documentation of income, taxes, assets, debt etc, as well as have your
   credit pulled. You will need to source any big deposits - remember and track this. I THINK you can use a 
   huge deposit be marked as a loan from Koala Investments...
5) The Lender will appraise the property (you will need to pay for this) - make sure to provide
   documentation for the lender to start with that states the case for your appraised value you are trying to 
   get. After the lender gets back the appraisal, you can also submit 3 comparables again for the appraiser 
   to re-evaluate - or give him/her some reason to adjust the property value.


Notes
----------------------
Ridge Lending requirements:
You can certainly do 20% down rather than 25%.
The reason for the 25% down payment requirement on this property was the fact that it had 4 units.
1 to 2 unit properties require 20% down
3 to 4 unit properties will require 25% down payment

Current Lender questions
---------------------------------
1. Can you do properties in Indiana?
2. Can I do 20% on an investment property?
3. Are you a lender, or a broker?
4. What are your typical lender fee points?
5. Have you heard of the quick refinance strategy - Under 6 months for a cash purchase?
   5a. What do I need to do to make that happen?
6. Minimum loan amount? 50k?
7. How long before I can count rental income as part of my DTI?

I'm looking for a 30 year fixed on a property that was just appraised at 95k - 20% available?

Talk to a lot of lenders to get the terms that you want - Ask Around!!


General Lender requirements
===========================================
Any funds need 60 days of seasoning (or an explanation) - 2 bank statements
