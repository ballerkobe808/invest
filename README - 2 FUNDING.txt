Hello! My is Daniel, and I'm an investor from Hawaii looking to invest in an Indianapolis rental property. 
I'm planning to purchase a duplex for \$96,000. I'm looking for a 30 year fixed loan with an interest rate of 
5.5%. I can put down 20%. The following is a list of some of my information. Please take a look and tell me 
whether you have a program I would qualify for.

- I live out of state
- My credit score is 760
- My current DTI is 31%
- I will have $40,000 in reserves after the down payment

If you don't have a program that I would qualify for, is there another institution you could recommend me to? 
Thank you very much for your time and consideration!

Daniel

Fill out the lenders application and get the prequalification letter.
This is helpful for the seller/realtor when you are buying so they know you are serious.
HOWEVER - Be careful because your credit will be pulled here - dont have it pulled unecessarily.


Questions to ask about the loan
-------------------------------------------
    1. What is the length and type of the loan? (30 yrs, 27, etc) (fixed, arm, etc)
    2. What is the rate? (APR%) (If variable, minx max)
    3. Origination Fee? Other fees? (Lenders will need a min of 4k in fees to be profitable)
    4. Any points up front to lower rate?
    5. Is there a pre-payment penalty?


Loan Points explanation:
----------------------------
Lender starts out at a base rate based on your credit score, assets, dti, current federal rates.

example: 5.00%
They will add points for different things:

- Non owner-occupied .5%
- Under 150k loan amount .25% (Under 75k even more??)
- Multifamily - .25%
- Others - 20% down???






Sources and Types of Funding
========================================
Conventional loan (bank or credit union)
Portfolio loan (bank or credit union)
hard money lenders (3-5 points, 12-15% interest),
private lenders (friends/family/partners)
lines of credit (personal or home equity),
credit cards,
401k/IRA,
seller financing.



Line of Credit (HELOC, or Personal LOC)
---------------------------------------------
The key thing to note, is that an LOC's interest is calculated PER DAY.
You can get the daily interest by taking the APR (Example: 2.7%), dividing by 12 - to get the monthly interest, 
then dividing that by 30 to get the daily interest. (They do it like this vs dividing by 365 according to the 
renautus guys).

Most Local banks have personal line of credit products - shop around and talk to other investors

HElOC
-----------------------
HELOCs are Home Equity Lines of Credit. It is a line of credit against the equity in your property that is 
above the 20% amount. Lets use 20% as a base number - every bank will have their own products and criteria. 
You must always have at least 20% in equity in your property. Any equity over this 20% can be used as 
collateral for a line of credit against it. Example:

1. 100k home, with 20k of my money/equity. Since I'm at 20% and have nothing above the 20%, I cannot get a HELOC
2. 100k home, with 40k of my money/equity. Since I'm over the 20% threshold by 20k, I can get a HELOC for 20k
3. 100k home, with 80k of my money/equity. Since I'm over the 20% threshold by 60k, i can get a HELOC for 60k

These often come with low 1.7-2% introductory APRs for the first year. You can do strategic things here 
- Once the introductory rate is over, you can pay it off or cancel and open another HELOC with another bank lol.

One thing to note is that HELOC % is calculated by the day, so any balance used in a month will be 
charged interest. Credit Cards are charged at the end of the month. Use your Credit Card for daily 
purchases (you get points too) and only use your HELOC to pay off your CC as needed.


Credit Cards
-----------------------
Always increase your limits given the chance. This helps you to lower your utilization % which helps your 
credit score, and also gives you access to more emergency funds should you need it.

You can get Introductory Rates and take out cash here...
I tried Plastiq and it was almost impossible to do even a small transfer. They act almost as a barrier and have a 
lengthy questioning period to avoid people taking cash.
The one intriguing option mentioned was the PayPal transfer. Wondering just how simple that really is and what the 
cost ends up being if itâ€™s still an option. 



General Tips
--------------------------
Get as much funding as you can when possible. Its easier to take out 100k from the start, versus going for 
20k, 20k, 40k, 20k in succession. Cool story of borrowing money from your friend using both methods.


General Lending Notes:
----------------------
1. Multifamily, cash out refi, and others will often require 25% down (for conventional loans)
2. Any funds need 60 days of seasoning (or an explanation) - 2 bank statements
3. Your DTI and Credit Score affect your rate and ability to get a loan
4. You need 6 months of reserves (6 principle and interest payments)


---------------------------------
Questions to ask a new Lender:
---------------------------------
1. Can you do properties in Indiana?
2. Can I do 20% on an investment property?
3. Are you a lender, or a broker?
4. What are your typical lender fee points?
5. Have you heard of the quick refinance strategy - Under 6 months for a cash purchase?
   5a. What do I need to do to make that happen?
6. Minimum loan amount? 50k?
7. How long before I can count rental income as part of my DTI?

Talk to a lot of lenders to get the terms that you want - Ask Around!!




Mortgage Information
---------------------------

Escrow Accounts
Escrow accounts are used in conjunction with your mortgage loan. 
They act as a savings account to hold money to pay for property taxes and homeowner's insurance. 
Each month, the payment you make to the mortgage company includes a portion that goes towards paying 
off the loan and a portion that goes into the escrow account. Because failure to pay property taxes 
can result in a tax lien or foreclosure, some lenders require borrowers to maintain an escrow account 
to ensure that the payments are being made on time.

Property Tax Payments
Your lender must work directly with the county tax collector to obtain the information on your property taxes. 
The county sends the tax bill to the lender for review. The lender then makes a payment to the county using 
the money from your escrow account. You should also receive a copy of your tax bill for your records; 
however, you don't need to pay your tax collector directly.

Escrow Calculations
The amount you pay into escrow each month is based on the yearly total amount you owe for property 
taxes and homeowner's insurance. The grand total is simply divided by 12 to reach the monthly payment amount. 
Most lenders like to keep some additional funds in the account to act as a safety-net or cushion in case 
of an unexpected increase in a bill. The lender is allowed, by law, to collect an additional two months 
worth of payments for this purpose.

Yearly Statements
At the end of each year, the lender reviews your escrow account to provide you with an account disclosure 
statement. The statement includes details of the payments into and out of the account. It will list the 
specific payments made to the tax collector by date. The statement also provides an analysis what your 
payments will be for the upcoming year. It's common for property taxes to increase over time as the 
assessed value of your property also increases. Additionally, you may overpay or underpay for the year. 
You'll either be issued a refund or owe the lender extra money.
