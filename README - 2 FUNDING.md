Hello! My is Daniel, and I'm an investor from Hawaii looking to invest in Tennessee rental property. This will be my first investment property, but I hope to do a lot more investing in your state in the near future. I'm planning to purchase a duplex for \$96,000. I'm looking for a 30 year fixed loan with an interest rate of 5.5%. I can put down 20%. The following is a list of some of my information. Please take a look and tell me whether you have a program I would qualify for.

- I live out of state
- My credit score is 760
- My current DTI is 31%
- I will have \$40,000 in reserves after the down payment

If you don't have a program that I would qualify for, is there another institution you could recommend me to? Thank you very much for your time and consideration!

Daniel

### 1.1.4. Get Pre-qualification letter

Fill out the lenders application and get the prequalification letter.
This is helpful for the seller/realtor when you are buying so they know you are serious

### 1.1.5. Questions to ask about the loan

    1. What is the length and type of the loan? (30 yrs, 27, etc) (fixed, arm, etc)
    2. What is the rate? (APR%) (If variable, minx max)
    3. Origination Fee? Other fees?
    4. Any points up front to lower rate?
    5. Is there a pre-payment penalty?

### Loan Points explanation

Lender starts out at a base rate based on your credit score, assets, dti, current federal rates.
5.00%
They will add points for different things:

- Non owner-occupied .5%
- Under 150k loan amount .25% (Under 75k even more??)
- Multifamily - .25%
- Others - 20% down???

## 1.2. Sources and Types of Funding

bank/credit union loan,
portfolio bank loan,
hard money lenders (3-5 points, 12-15% interest),
friends/family/partners,
lines of credit,
credit cards,
401k/IRA,
seller financing.

### 1.2.1. Line of Credit (HELOC, or Personal LOC)

The key thing to note, is that an LOC's interest is calculated PER DAY.
You can get the daily interest by taking the APR (Example: 2.7%), dividing by 12 - to get the monthly interest, then dividing that by 30 to get the daily interest. (They do it like this vs dividing by 365 according to the renautus guys).

Take out a line of credit at your local bank. For First Hawaiian Bank you can get one for 20k assuming your DTI is ok. If you want to go higher, you will have to provide some bank statements.

#### 1.2.2. HElOC

HELOCs are Home Equity Lines of Credit. It is a line of credit against the equity in your property that is above the 20% amount. You must always have at least 20% in equity in your property. Any equity over this 20% can be used as collateral for a line of credit against it. Example:

1. 100k home, with 20k of my money/equity. Since I'm at 20% and have nothing above the 20%, I cannot get a HELOC
2. 100k home, with 40k of my money/equity. Since I'm over the 20% threshold by 20k, I can get a HELOC for 20k
3. 100k home, with 80k of my money/equity. Since I'm over the 20% threshold by 60k, i can get a HELOC for 60k

These often come with low 1.7-2% introductory APRs for the first year. You can do strategic things here - Once the introductory rate is over, you can pay it off or cancel and open another HELOC with another bank lol.

One thing to note is that HELOC % is calculated by the day, so any balance used in a month will be charged interest. Credit Cards are charged at the end of the month. Use your Credit Card for daily purchases (you get points too) and only use your HELOC to pay off your CC as needed.

### 1.2.3. 401k/IRA (Individual Retirement Account)

- Pretax dollars put here (so you get more bang for your buck)
- Reduces income tax (money contributed is not counted as income)
- Must be 60 to withdraw penalty free, otherwise 10% penalty
- Roth means you put in after tax dollars
- 401k - 18k limit as of 2017, IRA 5.5k limit as of 2017
- Compound interest is POWERFUL!!!

#### 1.2.3.1. Datahouse 401k

- Datahouse is matching 20% of your investment up to 2400. Its added as a lump sum once a year in July.
- You have been averaging 10% yearly returns from your mutual funds investment.
- You can stop any time, but open enrollment is Dec to change amounts (for Jan implementation)

#### 1.2.3.2. Borrowing from your 401k

- You can borrow either 50% or 50k - whichever is less
- You have to pay back in 5 years unless its for a primary residence, or hardship, or special circumstance
- You will pay back interest but the interest all goes back to you
- If you quit or are fired, you have to pay it back in 60 days or incur a penalty
- Penalty for early withdrawal is 10%
- When you take it out for real, you pay income tax on it (Unless its a Roth)

### Credit Cards

Always increase your limits given the chance. This helps you to lower your utilization % which helps your credit score, and also gives you access to more emergency funds should you need it.

### Self-Directed IRA

### Some other Retirement fund?

### Tips

Get as much funding as you can when possible. Its easier to take out 100k from the start, versus going for 20k, 20k, 40k, 20k in succession. Cool story of borrowing money from your friend using both methods.

### Notes

You can certainly do 20% down rather than 25%.
The reason for the 25% down payment requirement on this property was the fact that it had 4 units.
1 to 2 unit properties require 20% down
3 to 4 unit properties will require 25% down payment

### Current Lender questions

1. Can you do properties in Indiana?
2. Can I do 20% on an investment property?
3. Are you a lender, or a broker?
4. What are your typical lender fee points?
5. Have you heard of the quick refinance strategy - Under 6 months for a cash purchase?
   5a. What do I need to do to make that happen?
6. Minimum loan amount? 50k?
7. How long before I can count rental income as part of my DTI?

I'm looking for a 30 year fixed on a property that was just appraised at 95k - 20% available?
