## 1.1. Getting Funding

---

There are many tools to choose from when deciding how to fund deals. Some options are loans from banks, credit unions, portfolio banks, hard money lenders, friends/family/partners, lines of credit, credit cards,
401k/IRA, seller financing.

Use Getfundedonline.com - to find the best instiutions and programs to apply to.

Get as much funding as you can when possible. Its easier to take out 100k from the start, versus going for 20k, 20k, 40k, 20k in succession. There is a cool story/illustration of borrowing money from your friend using both methods.

### 1.1.1. PROCESS - Collect and organize needed documents/records

Get all the documents you will need and into an organized folder

2. Send them an email like this:

3. See if you can form a partnership and relationship with them, and refer others to them. Make sure everyone knows you are the connector.

NOTE: Lane Kawaoka said certain banks wont fund investments, so its better to go with ones that are familiar with the process and the risk.

### 1.1.3. Current Lenders

- Quicken Loans -

- Highlands Mortgage -

- Ridge Lending -

- Bank of Hawaii -

- University of Hawaii Federal Credit Union -
  Great option to park money, or take out personal loans, credit cards, or even a mortgage at a really good rate.

  5-7.5% APR personal loans (up to 5x gross monthly income)
  8.5% Credit Card!!! (10k max)

### 1.1.4. Get Pre-qualification letter

Fill out the lenders application and get the prequalification letter.

### 1.1.5. Get Approved for a specific property

When you find the property you want to buy, begin the acutal loan application process. Send the contract over to the lender for review.

Some questions to review:

    What is the length of the loan? (30 yrs, 27, etc)
    What is the rate? (APR%)
    Origination Fee? Other fees?
    Any points up front?
    Is there a pre-payment penalty?

## 1.2. Sources and Types of Funding

---

### 1.2.1. Line of Credit (HELOC, or Personal LOC)

    The key thing to note, is that an LOC's interest is calculated PER DAY.
    You can get the daily interest by taking the APR (Example: 2.7%), dividing by 12 - to get the monthly interest, then dividing that by 30 to get the daily interest. (They do it like this vs dividing by 365 according to the renautus guys).

    Take out a line of credit at your local bank. For First Hawaiian Bank you can get one for 20k assuming your DTI is ok. If you want to go higher, you will have to provide some bank statements.

#### 1.2.2. HElOC

HELOCs are Home Equity Lines of Credit. It is a line of credit against the equity in your property that is above the 20% amount. You must always have at least 20% in equity in your property. Any equity over this 20% can be used as collateral for a line of credit against it. Example:

1. 100k home, with 20k of my money/equity. Since I'm at 20% and have nothing above the 20%, I cannot get a HELOC
2. 100k home, with 40k of my money/equity. Since I'm over the 20% threshold by 20k, I can get a HELOC for 20k
3. 100k home, with 80k of my money/equity. Since I'm over the 20% threshold by 60k, i can get a HELOC for 60k

These often come with low 1.7-2% introductory APRs for the first year. You can do strategic things here - Use that money to quickly pay off principle in another loan, and then pay this HELOC off using the lower % rate. Hawaii is known for really low APRs.

Once the introductory rate is over, you can pay it off or cancel and open another HELOC with another bank lol.

One thing to note is that HELOC % is calculated by the day, so any balance used in a month will be charged interest. Credit Cards on the other hand are only charged interest at the end of the month. Because of this, use your Credit Card for daily purchases and only use your HELOC to pay off your CC as needed. Credit Card will also return points on purchases.

Combine a HELOC, with a CC, and Mortgage to do a Velocity Banking Strategy. Open a HELOC, and use a huge chunk to pay off the mortgage principle (same property or another - the earlier the loan section the bigger the payoff). Keep a zero balance in your checking. Any day to day activities, use your CC to pay it off. At the end of the month use the HELOC to pay the CC balance. Any extra income goes toward paying down the HELOC balance. Get it to zero before the rate rises. Cancel, then open another HELOC at the introductory rate. Garret Taira perfected this strategy.

Banks will probably not fund your Rentals - you will need to go to a portfolio lender or open a business line of credit.

### 1.2.3. 401k/IRA (Individual Retirement Account)

- Pretax dollars put here (so you get more bang for your buck)
- Reduces income tax (money contributed is not counted as income)
- Must be 60 to withdraw penalty free, otherwise 10% penalty
- Roth means you put in after tax dollars
- 401k - 18k limit as of 2017, IRA 5.5k limit as of 2017
- Compound interest is POWERFUL!!!

#### 1.2.3.1. Datahouse 401k

- Datahouse is matching 20% of your investment up to 2400. Its added as a lump sum once a year in July.
- You have been averaging 10% yearly returns from your mutual funds investment.
- You can stop any time, but open enrollment is Dec to change amounts (for Jan implementation)

#### 1.2.3.2. Borrowing from your 401k

- You can borrow either 50% or 50k - whichever is less
- You have to pay back in 5 years unless its for a primary residence, or hardship, or special circumstance
- You will pay back interest but the interest all goes back to you
- If you quit or are fired, you have to pay it back in 60 days or incur a penalty
- Penalty for early withdrawal is 10%??
- When you take it out for real, you pay income tax on it (Unless its a Roth)

### Credit Cards

Always increase your limits given the chance. This helps you to lower your utilization % which helps your credit score, and also gives you access to more emergency funds should you need it.
