### Asset Protection and Lawsuits

Her plan involved placing the town-home in an LLC, which protected her personally from a liability nightmare. She used the series LLC structure, which meant that the home itself was in its own individual LLC. She owned two other properties, each of which had its own series. While the total value of these assets is rather high, the use of this structure protected her unrelated assets.
