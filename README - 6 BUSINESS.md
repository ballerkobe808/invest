# BUSINESS

Understand how things work, but always consult a CPA or RE Attorney

### 1.0.5. PROCESS - Creating an LLC

Create an LLC in the state you are buying the property in.
This helps when you need to evict or be a "business" in that state. Also, you will only be taxed in that state vs being registered as a foreign entity in that state, and get taxed there as well as in your home LLC state.

Incorporate in Nevada (great privacy laws) or Wyoming??

### LLC Documents

1. Articles of Incorporation
2. Minutes

### Starting up your Business

Start tracking all your expenses before u open your business. These are considered start up costs and can be written off. Your business is not legally open until your first sale.

You need a business address and registered agent address. If you dont want to use your own, you can use Mark Kohlers law firm to forward you mail - 150 for the business address and 125 for the registered agent address annually

### Keep good records

Keep an organized tracking of everything you do - start in excel, then move into quickbooks eventually. Suggest to use Mark Kohler and his firm in the future.
I found that excel is quicker and more powerful for me - i can run reports I need and update faster than waiting for the app to respond in the cloud - or be restricted by the way accounting works

### Asset Protection Strategies

Use an LLC to protect yourself and other assets from lawsuits from within your LLC
Using your 401k to own your LLCs is super safe - OJ Simpson did this.
Have an anonymous trust as the owner of your LLC for another level
If its too complex, lawyers will lose interest and it wont be worth their time.

### Structures of for-profit businesses

Each state will be slightly different

1. Sole Proprietership
   Simple to setup and dissolve, and cheapest. However, unlimited liability, and profits are reported on your personal tax return. Valid for 5 years.

2. Partnerships
   2 ore more people agree to share business. Each parter contributes and shares the profits and losses on their ind tax returns. General - At least one partner has unlimited liability. Limited - limits to personal liability of each partner

3. Corporation (C & S).
   Everyone says to go with an S - dont even consider a C for our purposes.

4. LLC
   attributes of a corporation and tax status of a partnership

### Anti-Lawsuit Strategy

File a Quit Claim Deed to move the property from you to your LLC
Information needed is who is it coming from, and where is it going to
If you get sued, the court will pull the latest document. If your name is where it is coming from, then the court will pull this document and you will be liable still.

You -> move the property to the S Corp. AFTER that, move the property to the --> LLC from the S Corp.
This second degree of separation will protect you.

If you get sued, then your name is not on the LLC Property deed, or the last document related to the property (it has the S Corp) so you are saved

Insurance:
1 Million dollar Umbrella - put this on your LLC to protect it. (about \$300/month) Never have more equity than insurance in each LLC. If you do, you are not gonna be covered. If you are going to exceed 1 Million, then move it to another LLC

All money collected - rent, flip profits etc, send it to your S Corp.

Dont have checks written to you. Always have it paid to your corporation, so its not personal earned income.

Name your S Corp something to do with Real Estate

Name your LLC Nothing to do with yourself - so it can't be tracked back to you.

### Kohlers 5 keys to maintain ur entity

1. Setup checking account
2. Own your property
3. Tell the world (URL, bus headers, email, contact info etc)
4. Contractral Requirements - have all contracts point to your entity and not you
5. Maintain the entity (Have minutes, board meetings, etc)

### Land Trust

There are two types of transfers that can potentially raise an alarm about the due on sale clause: (1) the transfer to an LLC and (2) the transfer to a trust. A transfer to an LLC will trigger the clause and should therefore be avoided even though banks are hesitant to ever foreclose as long as the note is being paid. Even with the note being paid, the banks will still send threatening letters. This issue can be avoided completely by transferring the property into a land trust.

While a transfer to an LLC will cause alarms at the bank and prompt them to send you a letter, a transfer to a trust will not. A transfer to a trust is exempt from due on sale violations since banks will view transfers to a trust as an estate planning tool. You should not even receive a letter from the bank.

This is part of the reason I recommend people consider transferring properties into a Land Trust prior to moving the properties into the LLC, or Series LLC. The Land Trust is also a private document, so you can also keep your name from public record if you create it the correct way.
