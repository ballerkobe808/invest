# BUSINESS

Understand how things work, but always consult a CPA or RE Attorney

### 1.0.5. PROCESS - Creating an LLC

Create an LLC in the state you are buying the property in

### Starting up your Business

Start tracking all your expenses before u open your business. These are considered start up costs and can be written off. Your business is not legally open until your first sale.

You need a business address and registered agent address. If you dont want to use your own, you can use Mark Kohlers law firm to forward you mail - 150 for the business address and 125 for the registered agent address annuaally

### Asset Protection Strategies

Use an LLC to protect yourself and other assets from lawsuits.
Use an anonymous trust as the owner of your LLC?
If its too complex, lawyers will lose interest and it wont be worth their time.

### Structures of for-profit businesses

Each state will be slightly different

1. Sole Proprietership
   Simple to setup and dissolve, and cheapest. However, unlimited liability, and profits are reported on your personal tax return. Valid for 5 years.

2. Partnerships
   2 ore more people agree to share business. Each parter contributes and shares the profits and losses on their ind tax returns. General - At least one partner has unlimited liability. Limited - limits to personal liability of each partner

3. Corporation (C & S).
   Cap said always go with S. It limits shareholders to 75, but avoids double taxation.

4. LLC
   attributes of a corporation and tax status of a partnership

### Anti-Lawsuit Strategy

File a Quit Claim Deed to move the property from you to your LLC
Information needed is who is it coming from, and where is it going to
If you get sued, the court will pull the latest document. If your name is where it is coming from, then the court will pull this document and you will be liable still.

You -> move the property to the S Corp. AFTER that, move the property to the --> LLC from the S Corp.
This second degree of separation will protect you.

If you get sued, then your name is not on the LLC Property deed, or the last document related to the property (it has the S Corp) so you are saved

Insurance:
1 Million dollar Umbrella - put this on your LLC to protect it. (about $300/month) Never have more equity than insurance in each LLC. If you do, you are not gonna be covered. If you are going to exceed 1 Million, then move it to another LLC

All money collected - rent, flip profits etc, send it to your S Corp.

Dont have checks written to you. Always have it paid to your corporation, so its not personal earned income.

Name your S Corp something to do with Real Estate

Name your LLC Nothing to do with yourself - so it can't be tracked back to you.
