TERMS
================

DTI (Debt to Income)
This is the first and biggest metric a lender looks at when deciding to lend you money. Its basically how much 
money you spend a month to cover your debts over how much you bring in.
This includes all things you are on the hook for - mortgage, car payments, loans, rent, etc. It does NOT 
include food, or variable living expenses.
It also takes your Gross Income (Not Net) Get your paychecks before taxes for the month. Things like 
rent will not be counted unless you can show income for 2 years (is this correct)

Debt/Income = DTI

Bank vs Actual DTI - Banks look at the DTI above, but for budgeting you really need to look at actual 
DTI taking into account living expenses and entertainment.

### 1.4.2. LTV Loan to Value ratio

This is the % the lender is giving u over the total value of the purchase. The lower the number for the lender, 
the better for them. Often this number can affect your interest rate.

### 1.4.3. Online Banking Savings Account Strategy

You can put your money in an online savings account and get 1.5-1.85% interest on your money. Be aware of 
minimum balances, maxiumum transactions per month, and transaction fees.

### 1.4.4. Keeping money in a Credit Union Savings

Another alternative is a Credit Union. 1% interest and less fees and hassle

### 1.4.5. Credit Card Introductory Rate strategy

Keep opening new Credit Cards for the sign up bonus, use it, then open another one with another sign up bonus. 
Biggest issue here is making sure that your credit score doesn't take a big hit, and managing the different 
accounts. You can net from 150-600 per new Credit Card open. Rinse and Repeat

### 1.4.6. APR (Annual percentage rate) vs APY (Annual percentage yield)

In APR, you just add the interest at the end of the year. For APY, you add each month's (could be day, 
quarter, etc) interest to that month before calculating the next month's interest. This is intra-year compounding.
Basically in APR, you only add the interest once a year - in APY, you add it for every period (quarterly, 
monthly, daily, etc)

APR = Periodic Rate x Number of periods in a year
APY = (1 + Periodic Rate)^Periods -1

Example: put $1000 in bank at 2% interest
Jan for APR and APY, you add$10000 _ 2% / 12 = $16.67
Feb for APR - same, BUT for APY, you take$10001.67 _ 2% / 12 = \$16.70
And so on...

### ARM Adjustable Rate Mortgage

5, 7, 9 year ARMs usually. The opposite is fixed rate. Dangerous if the rates are gonna go up later

reported on Form 5498, but rather on Form 5500-EZ, but only if the air market value of the solo 401k exceeds 
\$250K as of the end of the plan year (generally 12/31);

into the self-directed IRA is reported on Form 5498 by the receiving self-directed IRA custodian by May of

### Lease with an option strategy to buy

3 Options that will tenant will choose at the end

1. choose not to buy
2. choose to buy and use a bank
3. choose to buy and use you as the bank

The target tenant will be someone with 2300-4400 set aside for housing, that are looking to get their life 
back on track.
You kinda want a home that a family will live in, so at least 3/2 in hawaii, also safe neighborhoods

4 Types of Income from Lease Option

1. Non-refundable Option Payment (PCF)
2. Monthly Rent
3. Sale price is pre-negotiated and agreed upon by all parties
4. Tax Advantages (Deferment of sale allows you to Depreciate on your taxes)

Structuring the deal (Contract)

- 1-3 year lease, with option to buy
- They do minor repairs \$250 or less
- We do major repairs, \$250 or more
- Monthly Payment +20-30% of FMV for rentals in area
- Monthly payment to be paid in addition to lease for a credit toward down payment ("What can you afford")
- Option payment of 2-5% of current price
- They maintain interior insurance
- Negotiated future purchase price, year by year

### Refinancing

If you are looking to take cash out with a conventional loan in the first 6 months of ownership then you will 
have to meet the delayed financing guidelines. Main takeaways from delayed financing are

- the value of the property will be capped at the purchase price even if the home appraised higher.

- you will have to prove source of funds for the purchase

- if you opened any new unsecured debt when purchasing the home then that debt must be paid off when cashing 
out.

If you wait 6 months then these requirements are waived

### Long term view for Investing

I do find it crazy that everyone calls this a difficult time... Isn't it just back to normal. Just because a 
rare opportunity existed 8 years ago, doesn't mean that normal should be difficult. There are always deals 
to be made, you just have to be prepared to move when they come and have a toolbox full of options.

Here's my framework for pre-screening deals:

Buy with at least a 10% discount rate. i.e. $120k homes at $105k or $100k homes at $90k. This is including 
rehab budget, holding, and closing costs. This will ensure instant equity and higher ROI.
When purchasing with conventional (20% down or more) financing, look for homes that hit a price ratio around 
80 X 1 gross month's rent. This can also be figured as 1.25% of the full cost of the investment (acquisition, 
closing, rehab, and holding costs.)
Run several models and if you need more cash flow, than either pay down points or put a larger down payment 
down.
Here's where the real wealth building comes in to play. In a typical, established, Indianapolis neighborhood 
(C+ to B Class)... we see predictable appreciation of 2.5%-3.5% annually. With a 25% down payment, you are 
leveraged 4 to 1. This means that the COC ROI on appreciation will be 10%-14% (2.5% or 3.5% X 4.) 
This doesn't even include cash flow or principal paydown.

The clients that I have who are investing like this are doubling their initial cash investments every 
4-6 years. This is because of the internal nestegg that builds faster and better than the cash flow it 
produces. Unfortunately, equity is not cash, but you can leverage the equity in various ways to increase 
the size or quality of your portfolio and/or reposition it for higher cash flow.

There are many models for real estate investments and various positions that they can be done from, 
but I find that IRR and understanding the equity growth are not looked at deeply enough by many newer 
investors. I've seen too many investors build portfolios over 10-15 years that started with $50-$100k and
 now have \$1M+ net portfolio value. Much of it has to do with leveraging and compounding the growth of 
 all facets of your investment properties. While I don't recommend investing on speculative numbers, 
 the icing on the cake is often times better than the cake.
