## How to Take a Section 179 Deduction
-----------------------------------------------

1. First, you purchase qualified property and start using it during the year.

2. Then, you sit down with your tax professional at tax time. You will need records on the date of 
   purchase, date, you started using the property, and all costs associated with the purchase 
   (like freight and setup).

3. You add up all the items of property that are qualified. You will need to read the IRS information 
   carefully to make sure your property is qualified.

4. Then you can take the 179 deduction by electing it (described below). The amount of the 
   deduction is the total cost of all of the property, up to $500,000 for each individual item of property. 
   The total Section 179 deductions for all property can't exceed the $2 million maximum.

Use IRS Form 4562 to Elect a Section 179 Deduction
The form used to report information for a Section 179 deduction is IRS Form 4562. This form collects 
information on business property acquired and put into service (see above). For more details on completing 
Form 4562, see the IRS instructions for this form.

## Depreciation and Depreciation Recapture
-------------------------------------------

To recap the basics, upon the acquisition of a property the cost of the building and land are capitalized. 
If the building is a rental property or used in a trade or business, the cost attributable to the building 
is depreciated over 27.5 years (residential) or 39 years (non-residential) using the straight-line method 
for tax purposes. Land is non-depreciable therefore, no depreciation is permitted. In summary, the cost of 
the building is written off ratably over the life of the asset via annual depreciation deductions.

Depreciation deductions offer the property owner the tax benefit of a deduction at their personal ordinary 
income tax rates. Additionally, depreciation deductions reduce the cost basis of the property which 
ultimately determines the gain or loss upon the sale or disposition of the property. If sold as a 
long-term gain, under current tax laws, long-term capital gains tax rates range between 0% – 20% 
depending on the taxpayer’s level of income.

However, not all gains benefit from the long-term capital gain tax rates. Depreciation recapture is the 
portion of the gain attributable to the depreciation deductions previously allowed during the period the 
taxpayer owned the property. The depreciation recapture rate on this portion of the gain is 25%. The 
reasoning behind the depreciation recapture rules is since the taxpayer received the benefit of a 
depreciation deduction that offset ordinary income tax rates (a potential Federal tax savings of up to 39.6%), 
the government is not going to grant the most favorable capital gains rates on the portion of the gain 
relating to these prior depreciation deductions. The following examples illustrate the concept of 
depreciation recapture.

Assume a property owner acquired a building for $2 million (excluding land). Assume after 10 years the 
owner has taken $500,000 of depreciation deductions. The owner’s basis in the building is now $1.5 million. 
If the owner sells the building for $5 million, they will recognize a gain of $3.5 million 
($5 million less $1.5 million). It is often presumed the $3.5 million would be taxed at a capital gain 
rate of 20%. However, in this example, $500,000 of the gain would be taxed at the recapture rate of 25%. 
The remaining $3 million gain would be taxed at the 20% capital gain rate. The outcome in this example is 
an additional $25,000 tax cost (5% on $500,000). Larger transactions would obviously have larger implications.

Depreciation recapture is limited to the lesser of the gain or, the depreciation previously taken. 
Using the example above, assume the owner sells the building for $1.6 million resulting in a gain of 
only $100,000. Since the $100,000 gain is less than the $500,000 of depreciation deductions the recapture 
rate of 25% would apply to the entire \$100,000 gain.

In the event a property is sold at a loss the depreciation recapture rules do not apply. Assume in the 
above example the property was sold for $1.1 million. The property owner would simply report a loss of 
$400,000. No depreciation recapture calculations would be required.

The 25% depreciation recapture tax rate only applies to the portion of the gain attributable to real 
property. If a sales contract includes the sale of other assets, such as furniture and equipment, 
the gain relating to depreciation recapture on those assets would be taxed at the property owner’s 
ordinary income tax rates.
