# FINDING PROPERTIES

Always be on the lookout.
Keep learning and collecting data points - helps you to internalize value and recognize deals quickly.
Most important is finding the deal - deals are made WHEN BUYING!!

### How to find Value

There has to be a reason why you can get the house at under market value. Be aware of this!
Keys to a property you want:

1. The house needs upgrade/repair/Foreclosing/Bank owned and wants to unload
2. The owner is motivated to sell under market value
3. It is in an area of town where people want to live (there will be demand to rent/buy later)

### Rental Portfolio

- Single/Multifamily Rentals with over 1.2% Rent to Value ratio.
- Be aware of too good to be true 2% RtV - often bad neighborhoods and not worth the headache - tip from experienced investors - also beware maint costs - same price for new HVAC in 50k and 100k house
- Solid Property Management - either in place or able to connect with some (So important! This is a make or break aspect - can make life terrible or awesome later)
- Great Locations!! This is very important. I want somewhere that people will want to rent, and that will be easy to manage. One eviction = thousands in damage, vacancy, legal fees, etc. Don't just look at spreadsheet numbers

### PROCESS - Finding New Agents

Look on Zillow (Zillow.com/agent-finder.) or Yelp and send an email to the agent with the following information:

1. That you are an investor who understands real estate
2. What specifically you are looking for
3. How you intend to purchase (loan, cash, and so on)
4. How you heard about the agent

Sample Email:

Sort through agents, and find one that will be able to bring you good deals. Also look at it from his/her point of view too. What is he/she getting - will you be doing a lot of business, bringing business their way?Rewarding them with extra compensation or helping them out too? Be aware of what value u bring to the transaction.

### Foreclosures

1. Preforeclosure. The property is listed to be sold at a public auction. Investors can purchase directly from the seller during the preforeclosure period.

2. Public Auction. The property iss put up for public auction, usually at the county courthouse. Investors bid on the property.

3. Real Estate Owned. If the property doesn't sell at auction, it goes back to the lender. Investors can purchase the property from the lender.

- U.S Dept of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)

- Federal National Mortgage Insurance Association (Fannie Mae)
- Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac)

- Property Tax Sales (check your local taxing authority)

### Tips
