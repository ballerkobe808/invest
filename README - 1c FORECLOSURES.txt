Foreclosures
=========================
1. Preforeclosure. The property is listed to be sold at a public auction. 
Investors can purchase directly from the seller during the preforeclosure period.

2. Public Auction. The property iss put up for public auction, usually at the county courthouse. 
Investors bid on the property.

3. Real Estate Owned. If the property doesn't sell at auction, it goes back to the lender. 
Investors can purchase the property from the lender.

- U.S Dept of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
- Veterans Administration (VA)

### Foreclosure -

never do one for less than 30k
It should never take you more than 15 hours to do one of these

Mortgage (sometimes this is called a trustee in certain states)
Types of Foreclosures
non-judicial: (25 states Hawaii is one of these)
judicial: is one that is done thru the court system
strict: connecticut is the only one - its different

publication - what hawaii calls the step of moving pre-forclosure to foreclosure
(30 other states use notice of defalt, notice of complaint, etc)

3 months - in hawaii - lender files publication then the auction happens
(other states have diff amount of monthes, 1, 2, 5, 7 months etc)

Hawaii:

1. you miss a payment - you get a late fee
2. you miss 3 months and 1 day behind - now the state offers the lender the right to file the publication. 
   Same for all states
3. Once the lender files (they dont have too) this starts a 3 month clock. When that date hits, 
   they lose their house
4. Focus on the Pre-foreclosures here. This is where you start to apply your wholesale skills. 
   Trying to solve peoples problems

1. less competition
2. less money
3. less time

The sequence

- Delinquency Notice
- Notice of Default
- Reinstatement Period
- Date of publication
- Date of sale
- Deficiency Judgement - washes the house clean of the bad liens

publications must be in the paper or in the courthouse
(it can optional be online TOO, but it has to be in the prev two by law)

Power of Sale - Dont buy it and pay closing cost - just have the option to sell

### Title search

Shows every lien or encumbrance

- if anything shows up - you have to take it one extra step
  homeowner has to sign
  "Authorization to release information" form

1. gives you permission to contact lienholders to see if debt is still owed -
2. gives you permission to negotiate on the owners behalf

Its possible the lien expired - all liens but 2 expire in 7 years or less
(IRS never goes away, Tax lien or deed never goes away)

Careful when you pull the title search and things have expired - no indicaion on the record itself.
