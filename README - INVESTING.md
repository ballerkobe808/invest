  - Keep researching and looking at real estate - constantly collect data points - the more you see, the better you instinct on what a good deal is becomes (you need to internalize this)
  - Truepeoplesearch - find the person owning the property and contact them directly?

## PROCESS - Researching a Property

1. Property Location

   - Population - is it growing?
   - Is the Job market diversified? (If a big company pulls out of the area, will jobs be lost?)
   - Any new companies moving in soon?
   - Is it an emerging neighborhood? (How to determine this?)

   - What are the Property taxes?
   - WEBSITE TO FIND THIS - MAKE A PROCESS

   - What are the insurance prices in the area?
   - Any special conditions? Flood zone, or hurricane prone (Florida, etc)
   - WEBSITE TO FIND THIS - MAKE A PROCESS

   - RESEARCH OTHER APPRECIATION/DEPRECIATION FACTORS

2. Turnkey Company

   - What is their role in the Selling/Aquisition/Management process?
   - Are they just a wholesaler?
   - Did they rehab the property themselves? If not, who did?
   - What is their repuation like on Bigger Pockets?

3. Property Value

   - Plug values into the Investment Calculator
   - Property Tax: https://www.qpublic.net/
   - Insurance Rates
   - What is my minimum monthly cashflow? (200 to be safe after main, cap ex, etc.)
   - Be aware of Neighborhood class - C/D could have more issues
   - Does the property need repairs currently? Will it soon?
   - How sure is the Rent price?
   - Deals are made going in - Make sure its a good investment!! You can always find another..

4. Current Tenancy

   - Are there Tenants currently?
   - Rent rolls available?
   - Current Lease?

5. Property Management

   - Is there a listing fee charge?
   - Do they charge when there is a vacancy?
   - How much experience do they have

### Insurance

Home Owners
Liability
Flood?

### PROCESS - Finding a Lender and getting approved

1. Get all the documents you will need and into an organized folder

   - W2s for the last 2 years
   - 2 months of all Bank Statements (has to be full statements - not printed html)
   - 2 paychecks of current employer(s)
   - 401k Statment(s)
   - Any stock or investment statements
   - Documentation on existing loans and properties

2. Search for and contact a Lender
   You can do this through a web search or through referral from a friend. Lane Kawaoka said certain banks wont fund investments, so its better to go with ones that are familiar with the process and the risk. Current lenders I have a relationship with are:

   - Quicken Loans
   - Highlands Mortgage
   - Ridge Lending
   - Bank of Hawaii

3. Fill out the prequalification and get prequalified
   This should end with a prequalification letter. Be Responsive Here!!

4. When you find the property you want to buy, begin the acutal loan application process.

## PROCESS - Purchase and Closing on the property

1. Submit Bid and reach an Agreement with Seller

   Work with a real estate agent. Put in an offer for the property through your real estate agent.
   Important! Ask for the seller to cover the closing costs, and offer a higher price to make up for it. This will help you put less down and increase your ROI, while increasing your monthly mortgage by a super tiny amount.

   Get the counter offer and discuss with your agent or advisors. Submit a counter offer. Repeat the process until satisfied and you reach an agreement.

2. Home Inspection

3. Lender Appraisal

### Real Estate Tax Benefits and Strategies

Great Resource at: https://www.madfientist.com/tax-benefits-of-real-estate-investing

1.  Depreciation Tax Deduction
    The IRS uses depreciation to acknowledge that an asset wears down over time. Somehow they discovered that residential real estate wears down in exactly 27.5 years. Unlike other business expenses, depreciation is a paper loss. This means you don’t spend any money, yet you still get the expense. This expense can offset taxable income and save money on your tax bill.
    Depreciation is only deductible against other passive income. If your rental income is 3k, depreciation is 5k, you have a 2k loss. Can you deduct that 2k somewhere else? ONLY IF:

    1. $25,000 exemption – You can deduct up to $25,000 of passive rental loss against nonpassive income if your income (MAGI to be exact) is below $100,000 and you actively participate with your rental. https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/can-you-deduct-your-rental-losses.html

    2. Real estate professional – You can deduct ALL of the passive rental loss against nonpassive income if you or a spouse qualify as a real estate professional. Hhere are the standards: https://www.biggerpockets.com/renewsblog/2014/09/25/your-complete-guide-to-the-real-estate-professional-tax-loophole

    3. Year of sale – You can deduct ALL of the passive rental loss (even from past years) against nonpassive income the year you sell the rental property.

    Example of how tax deductions work:

    > Scenario #1 (without depreciation expense):
    > $5,000 taxable rental income x 25% federal income tax rate = $1,250 taxes owed
    > Scenario #2 (with depreciation expense):
    > $5,000 rental income – $3,000 depreciation expense = $2,000 taxable rental income
    > $2,000 x 25% federal income tax rate = $500 taxes owed
    > Tax Savings = $1,250 – $500 = $750

2.  Avoid FICA (Payroll) Tax on Rental Income
    Just like dividends and interest income, rental income is not subject to social security and medicare taxes (aka FICA).
    If you earn money at a normal salaried job, you pay 7.65% (as of 2018) of your salary in FICA taxes. If you’re self-employed, you pay 15.3% towards FICA tax. For Rental income you pay 0!!

3.  No Tax On Appreciation (aka Buy & Hold Like Buffett)
    And real estate appreciation doesn’t get taxed by the IRS. So, if you buy and hold for many years it’s possible to let your net worth grow with no tax exposure.

4.  Capital Gains Tax at Lower Rates
    As of 2018, long-term capital gains tax rates are between 0% to 20%, depending upon your tax bracket. Low capital gains rates are an advantage if you build your long-term investment strategy around strategically selling real estate for growth or living expenses. At the point when you are in a low Capital gains Tax bracket (retired or stop working), sell your proprties for 0% (or low) Capital gains Tax.

5.  Live In Your Flip = No Taxes
    What if you want to avoid capital gains tax altogether? Then just buy and immediately move into the house as your principle residence. As long as you live in the home 2 out of the next 5 years, in the U.S. you can make a tax-free profit of up to $250,000 as an individual or $500,000 as a couple. Keep in mind that this doesn’t have to be a permanent strategy. You could do 2 or 3 flips, reinvest the earnings, and move on to other investment strategies.

6.  Exchange Properties For Tax-Free Growth (1031 Exchange)
    Another way to avoid capital gains tax (and also depreciation recapture tax) is a section 1031 tax-free exchange.
    A 1031 exchange allows you to trade one property for another without paying taxes. You must follow specific rules, and you must be classified as an investor (i.e. not a dealer who flips houses).

7.  Installment Sales For Income & Deferred Taxes
    This is where the seller becomes the lender to the buyer (aka seller financing or seller carry-back mortgage).
    Like 1031 exchanges, installment sales are only available to property investors and not to dealers (house flippers). Also like 1031 exchanges, installment sales allow an investor to defer capital gains tax, but unfortunately the entire amount of accumulated depreciation must be recaptured at the initial time of sale.

    For example, you buy a property at 50k, but it is now worth 300k. An installment sale would allow you to only pay taxes on the profits received each year. A $250,000 gain at one time would have pushed you into higher tax brackets. But the installment sale allows you to slowly receive the gains and possibly stay in lower, more favorable tax brackets. Installment sales can be a great way to transition out of active property management and into a period of more passive income.

8.  Borrow Tax-Free Instead of Sell
    To raise cash most investors consider selling investments. As I’ve shown above, this exposes you to taxes or complicated procedures to avoid tax. But with real estate you have another choice. You can simply pull capital out of an investment tax-free by refinancing. In the end when I need money, I am leaning towards refinancing the properties instead of selling. As long as the debt is fixed interest, low rate, and have renters to cover this expense this is a good situation. Some benefits:

    - Get to keep a well-performing property that I know very well
    - Benefit from future loan amortization as my tenants pay it off again
    - Benefit from future appreciation of rents and property price
    - NO tax paid on the cash from the refinance because it’s borrowed

9.  Self-Directed IRA Real Estate Investing
    You can actually use your IRA or 401k to invest in real estate. But most larger retirement account custodians (i.e. Vanguard, Schwab, etc) do not choose to offer them as a possibility. So, there is an entire industry of specialized custodians who do allow investments in these non-traditional assets. A google search will give you dozens of possibilities. A good company is American IRA. This can be complicated and not recommended unless doing more research. The way to go though, is a loan against real estate. It’s lower risk and has fewer moving parts than actually owning the real estate itself. I have also purchased local property tax liens, which often pay high interest rates and even sometimes get you a deed to real estate for pennies on the dollar.

10. Die With Real Estate (Seriously)
    Heirs dont pay capital gain taxes on your gains.

    For example, let’s say you bought a rental house for $100,000. Forty years later you die and the house is worth $500,000. When your heirs sell the house, they would not pay capital gains tax on the $400,000 gain. Instead, their basis would be $500,000, which means they could sell it for $500,000 and have no capital gains tax to pay.

    Keep in mind that inherited assets are still subject to estate taxes. But as of this writing (2018) $11.18 million of assets are exempt from any estate taxes. So, your heirs would inherit a lot of property before paying any taxes.

11. Business Tax Deductions?
    Can these be deducted from RE and also personal Income too? RESEARCH MORE WITH A CPA
    - Dinners with clients
    - Trips (They have to start out as business - you cannot go and then do business on a whim after)
    - Home office
    - Computer, Wifi, etc
    - Keep receipts
