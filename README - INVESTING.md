Freedom to spend more time with wife and family.
Freedom from worrying about money.
Freedom from being forced to work hard in a job with no end.
Ability to help others around me.

## Growing in this space and as a person

1. Build your team

   - inner circle - mentors/peers - more exp and success than you and willing to help/guide you - board of directors or millionaire masterminds - will help or connect u, could be support circle too - touch them once a month
   - support circle - professional team - advice and management - details of what you need and will help find people you will contact - transaction advisors and managers - have ability to manage the diff pieces (real estate agent, etc) touch them on every transaction
   - service circle - independent contractors - inspectors, electricians, painters - limited scope - personally direct or support team will direct

2. Building Relationships

   - Call them once a month - 2 calls a day will touch everyone in your network
   - Mail them something interesting every month
   - See them every month in person
   - Review you net worth worksheet with someone - and ask them to keep you accountable
   - Ask yourself - who am i calling today, who am I seeing this week, who am I mailing this month?
   - Two questions to ask someone:
     - Who do you know that I should know?
     - What would you do if you were me?

3. Build a reputation

   - Do deals - you need to be involved - make offers, take deals, etc
   - Keep your word - do what you promise, and show up on time
   - Dont talk bad about anyone - nobody trusts a gossip
   - Dont short change anyone - time or money
   - Refer business to your network - help people make connections

4. Reading/Listening to Books and Watching Videos

   - Keep growing and learning!!

## PROCESS - Finding a Property (Generating Leads)

- What am I looking for (Initial Property filter)

  - Turnkeys in the 80-120k range. Below 70k will be bad neighborhoods or need massive repairs. This also seems best reserve amount - 10% of 70k is 70 a month, while 10% of 100k is 100 a month, even tho water heaters cost the same for both properties...
  - Positive cashflow - most important part, more than appreciation
  - A/B Neighborhoods - Sticking to decent neighborhoods - there are too many horror stories from friends an online about C and D class neighborhoods. Anson has a few lol.
  - No Section 8 housing - Same as the C/D class neighborhoods, too much risk and cause for headaches down the road.
  - Property management in place. Its important to not only have a property manager, but a good reliable one in place here. This will make or break your rents in the future, and will be your lifeline down the road.
  - Already rented, or property manager confident can find renters quickly.

- Avenues to find them

  - Personal Contacts/Network
  - Turnkey Providers (Norada, ReiTrader, JWB, Memphis Invest)
  - Craigslist
  - MLS

- General tips
  - Always be on the lookout - Finding good deals is the most important part of investing
  - Keep researching and looking at real estate - constantly collect data points - the more you see, the better your instinct on what a good deal is becomes (you need to internalize this)
  - Truepeoplesearch - find the person owning the property and contact them directly?

## PROCESS - Researching a Property

1. Property Location

   - Use NeighborhoodScout for a report: https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/
   - Population makeup - ethnicity, age, demographics, crime, etc.
   - Population growth? Is it growing?
   - Is the Job market diversified? (If a big company pulls out of the area, will jobs be lost?)
   - Any new companies moving in or out soon? Any big events trending soon?
   - Housing market - Are prices going up? Also look for a low foreclosure %
   - Look for a low cost of living.
   - What is the vacancy rate of the city?
   - What are the insurance prices in the area?
   - Any special conditions? Flood zone, or hurricane prone (Florida, etc)
   - Nice graphic about appreciation and cashflow here: [link image]

2. Turnkey Company & Questions to ask

   - Vetting the Turnkey Vendor will make life easier in the long run. Find out as much as you can about them as a company to see if you can work with them, or thier providers.
   - What is their repuation like on Bigger Pockets?

   Questions

   - Can you tell me more about your company?
   - What is your role in the process? Buy? Rehab? Sell? Property Management? (This always better if they own the entire process - makes it easier to find a point of contact and back up their work)
   - If you are a middle man, how do you vet the actual providers?
   - Ask them "What separates you from other companies?"

3. Property Value & Questions to ask

   - Pass the initial property filter in the "What am I looking for" section above
   - Plug values into the Investment Calculator - good margin?
   - Monthly Property Tax: https://www.qpublic.net/
   - Monthly Insurance
   - What is my minimum monthly cashflow? (200 to be safe after main, cap ex, etc.)
   - Does the property need repairs currently? Will it soon?
   - How sure is the Rent price?
   - Deals are made going in - Make sure its a good investment!! You can always find another..
   - RESEARCH THIS: Best value around the 100k range?? Too cheap and you get issues? Also as you go lower in price % maint and % cap exp go down - even tho things will cost around the same...

   Questions:

   - Do you own the property? If not, who is the company/person who is selling it? Always better selling their own
   - Was the property rehabbed? Who did the rehab? Always better to know the rehab workmanship personally
   - Does it currently need any repairs? If so, what do you think the estimated costs will be?

4. Property Management & Tenancy & Questions to ask

   - Find out more about the property management team and make sure you are comfortable working with them, and they have reasonable rates. Nothing is more important to the success of your property or peace of mind, than the property management company and their communication, responsiveness, and committment to excellence.

   Questions:

   - Can you tell me more about your property management company? (How much experience do they have?) How do you handle problems - how big are you? Processes in place..?
   - Is there a listing fee charge or placement charge? How much...
   - What is their average vacancy rate? (Charge when there is a vacancy?) So important to keep rentals filled...
   - Are there Tenants currently? (Rent Rolls available?) (Lease Agreements?) How sure is the rental price?

### PROCESS - Creating an LLC

### PROCESS - Finding a Lender and getting approved

1. Get all the documents you will need and into an organized folder

   - W2s for the last 2 years
   - 2 months of all Bank Statements (has to be full statements - not printed html)
   - 2 paychecks of current employer(s)
   - 401k Statment(s)
   - Any stock or investment statements
   - Documentation on existing loans and properties

2. Search for and contact a Lender
   You can do this through a web search or through referral from a friend. Lane Kawaoka said certain banks wont fund investments, so its better to go with ones that are familiar with the process and the risk. Current lenders I have a relationship with are:

   - Quicken Loans
   - Highlands Mortgage
   - Ridge Lending
   - Bank of Hawaii

3. Fill out the prequalification and get prequalified
   This should end with a prequalification letter. Be Responsive Here!!

4. When you find the property you want to buy, begin the acutal loan application process.

5. Questions to ask about the loan

   - Is there a prepayment penalty?

## PROCESS - Purchase and Closing on the property

NOTE: Save all documentation with everything you do in an organized way! This will make life easier in the future.

1. Submit Bid and reach an Agreement with Seller

   Work with a real estate agent. Put in an offer for the property through your real estate agent.
   Important! Ask for the seller to cover the closing costs, and offer a higher price to make up for it. Maxiumum amount allowed by an investment propert is 2% for a conventional loan. (6% for FHA)

   Get the counter offer and discuss with your agent or advisors. Submit a counter offer. Repeat the process until satisfied and you reach an agreement.

2. Home Inspection
   Get an inspection - important to know what you are getting - about $300-$500.
   Work with seller/turnkey company to get things fixed that need to be.

3. Lender Appraisal
   Get an appraisal of the property (usually the lender will order this and its to keep themselves safe) If it comes back lower than expected, you are not obligated to buy it. I'm prolly paying for this - takes about a week.

4. Connect with the property manager -
   stay in touch with him - gotta give him banking info so he can send rents over to you. (figure out of its rented already, or to be rented - in that case its a target rent. 80% of the time its rented currently)

5. About 60-75 days from the time you sign the purchase agreement to the time you sign the closing documents. (up to 90 days) If its close to the closing date and its not close, then email your investment counselor.
   Communicate in a timely manner with:
   Turnkey Investment Counselor
   Lender (or mortgage broker)
   Title Company

## PROCESS - Filing Taxes at the end of the year

- PROCESS TO DO TAXES AT THE END OF THE YEAR

### Real Estate Tax Benefits and Strategies

Great Resource at: https://www.madfientist.com/tax-benefits-of-real-estate-investing

1.  Depreciation Tax Deduction
    The IRS uses depreciation to acknowledge that an asset wears down over time. Somehow they discovered that residential real estate wears down in exactly 27.5 years. Unlike other business expenses, depreciation is a paper loss. This means you don’t spend any money, yet you still get the expense. This expense can offset taxable income and save money on your tax bill.
    Depreciation is only deductible against other passive income. If your rental income is 3k, depreciation is 5k, you have a 2k loss. Can you deduct that 2k somewhere else? ONLY IF:

    1. $25,000 exemption – You can deduct up to $25,000 of passive rental loss against nonpassive income if your income (MAGI to be exact) is below $100,000 and you actively participate with your rental. https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/can-you-deduct-your-rental-losses.html

    2. Real estate professional – You can deduct ALL of the passive rental loss against nonpassive income if you or a spouse qualify as a real estate professional. Hhere are the standards: https://www.biggerpockets.com/renewsblog/2014/09/25/your-complete-guide-to-the-real-estate-professional-tax-loophole

    3. Year of sale – You can deduct ALL of the passive rental loss (even from past years) against nonpassive income the year you sell the rental property.

    Example of how tax deductions work:

    > Scenario #1 (without depreciation expense):
    > $5,000 taxable rental income x 25% federal income tax rate = $1,250 taxes owed
    > Scenario #2 (with depreciation expense):
    > $5,000 rental income – $3,000 depreciation expense = $2,000 taxable rental income
    > $2,000 x 25% federal income tax rate = $500 taxes owed
    > Tax Savings = $1,250 – $500 = $750

2.  Avoid FICA (Payroll) Tax on Rental Income
    Just like dividends and interest income, rental income is not subject to social security and medicare taxes (aka FICA).
    If you earn money at a normal salaried job, you pay 7.65% (as of 2018) of your salary in FICA taxes. If you’re self-employed, you pay 15.3% towards FICA tax. For Rental income you pay 0!!

3.  No Tax On Appreciation (aka Buy & Hold Like Buffett)
    And real estate appreciation doesn’t get taxed by the IRS. So, if you buy and hold for many years it’s possible to let your net worth grow with no tax exposure.

4.  Capital Gains Tax at Lower Rates
    As of 2018, long-term capital gains tax rates are between 0% to 20%, depending upon your tax bracket. Low capital gains rates are an advantage if you build your long-term investment strategy around strategically selling real estate for growth or living expenses. At the point when you are in a low Capital gains Tax bracket (retired or stop working), sell your proprties for 0% (or low) Capital gains Tax.

5.  Live In Your Flip = No Taxes
    What if you want to avoid capital gains tax altogether? Then just buy and immediately move into the house as your principle residence. As long as you live in the home 2 out of the next 5 years, in the U.S. you can make a tax-free profit of up to $250,000 as an individual or $500,000 as a couple. Keep in mind that this doesn’t have to be a permanent strategy. You could do 2 or 3 flips, reinvest the earnings, and move on to other investment strategies.

6.  Exchange Properties For Tax-Free Growth (1031 Exchange)
    Another way to avoid capital gains tax (and also depreciation recapture tax) is a section 1031 tax-free exchange.
    A 1031 exchange allows you to trade one property for another without paying taxes. You must follow specific rules, and you must be classified as an investor (i.e. not a dealer who flips houses).

7.  Installment Sales For Income & Deferred Taxes
    This is where the seller becomes the lender to the buyer (aka seller financing or seller carry-back mortgage).
    Like 1031 exchanges, installment sales are only available to property investors and not to dealers (house flippers). Also like 1031 exchanges, installment sales allow an investor to defer capital gains tax, but unfortunately the entire amount of accumulated depreciation must be recaptured at the initial time of sale.

    For example, you buy a property at 50k, but it is now worth 300k. An installment sale would allow you to only pay taxes on the profits received each year. A $250,000 gain at one time would have pushed you into higher tax brackets. But the installment sale allows you to slowly receive the gains and possibly stay in lower, more favorable tax brackets. Installment sales can be a great way to transition out of active property management and into a period of more passive income.

8.  Borrow Tax-Free Instead of Sell
    To raise cash most investors consider selling investments. As I’ve shown above, this exposes you to taxes or complicated procedures to avoid tax. But with real estate you have another choice. You can simply pull capital out of an investment tax-free by refinancing. In the end when I need money, I am leaning towards refinancing the properties instead of selling. As long as the debt is fixed interest, low rate, and have renters to cover this expense this is a good situation. Some benefits:

    - Get to keep a well-performing property that I know very well
    - Benefit from future loan amortization as my tenants pay it off again
    - Benefit from future appreciation of rents and property price
    - NO tax paid on the cash from the refinance because it’s borrowed

9.  Self-Directed IRA Real Estate Investing
    You can actually use your IRA or 401k to invest in real estate. But most larger retirement account custodians (i.e. Vanguard, Schwab, etc) do not choose to offer them as a possibility. So, there is an entire industry of specialized custodians who do allow investments in these non-traditional assets. A google search will give you dozens of possibilities. A good company is American IRA. This can be complicated and not recommended unless doing more research. The way to go though, is a loan against real estate. It’s lower risk and has fewer moving parts than actually owning the real estate itself. I have also purchased local property tax liens, which often pay high interest rates and even sometimes get you a deed to real estate for pennies on the dollar.

10. Die With Real Estate (Seriously)
    Heirs dont pay capital gain taxes on your gains.

    For example, let’s say you bought a rental house for $100,000. Forty years later you die and the house is worth $500,000. When your heirs sell the house, they would not pay capital gains tax on the $400,000 gain. Instead, their basis would be $500,000, which means they could sell it for $500,000 and have no capital gains tax to pay.

    Keep in mind that inherited assets are still subject to estate taxes. But as of this writing (2018) $11.18 million of assets are exempt from any estate taxes. So, your heirs would inherit a lot of property before paying any taxes.

11. Business Tax Deductions?
    Can these be deducted from RE and also personal Income too? RESEARCH MORE WITH A CPA
    - Dinners with clients
    - Trips (They have to start out as business - you cannot go and then do business on a whim after)
    - Home office
    - Computer, Wifi, etc
    - Keep receipts

### Velocity Banking Mortgage Payment Strategy

The idea is to take out either HELOCs, 401k loans, or even CC's and pay off your principle as early as possible to get your mortgage payments into the section where you are paying less interest. This is super important in the front part of the loan, but less important toward the end. This is because the front end of the loan is loaded with mostly interest. You will need extra income every month to make this work. Here is an Example using my Aalii loan:

Purchase Price: 285k
Down payment (20%): 57k
Mortage Amount: 228k:

1. 5.5% APR Loan over 30 years mininum payments ($1295/month).
   $238k in Total Interest.
2. Take out a CC at 20% APR for 30k, and pay that back over 4 years (+$913/month). Apply to priniple.
   This monthly payment is on top the $1295/month of the mortgage. You pay $14k interest for the CC, and save 94k in mortgage interest.
   This is $158k in Total Interest - Saving $80k
3. Take out a 401k loan at 7% APR for 50k, and pay that pack over 5 years (+990/month). Apply to priniple.
   This monthly payment is on top the $1295/month of the mortgage. You pay $9400 interest for the 401k loan and save $116k in mortgage interest.
   This is $131k in Total Interest - Saving $107k
4. Do it again after 5 years - Same 50k loan from 401k for 5 years (current balance of 158k). Apply to priniple.
   You pay the same +990/month and 9400 in interest for the 401k loan, but save 45k more interest.
   This will be 86k in Total Interest - Saving $152k

Note: Ask the lender if there are pre-payment fees. If so, dont go with that lender, because you will be penalized for doing this. Also, when making the principle only payment - be sure to tell the lender it is a principle only payment. If you sign the slip wrong or they mark it wrong, then it wont go well for you...

### HElOC

HELOCs are Home Equity Lines of Credit. It is a line of credit against the equity in your property that is above the 20% amount. You must always have at least 20% in equity in your property. Any equity over this 20% can be used as collateral for a line of credit against it. Example:

1. 100k home, with 20k of my money/equity. Since I'm at 20% and have nothing above the 20%, I cannot get a HELOC
2. 100k home, with 40k of my money/equity. Since I'm over the 20% threshold by 20k, I can get a HELOC for 20k
3. 100k home, with 80k of my money/equity. Since I'm over the 20% threshold by 60k, i can get a HELOC for 60k

These often come with low 1.7-2% introductory APRs for the first year. You can do strategic things here - Use that money to quickly pay off principle in another loan, and then pay this HELOC off using the lower % rate. Hawaii is known for really low APRs.

Once the introductory rate is over, you can pay it off or cancel and open another HELOC with another bank lol.

One thing to note is that HELOC % is calculated by the day, so any balance used in a month will be charged interest. Credit Cards on the other hand are only charged interest at the end of the month. Because of this, use your Credit Card for daily purchases and only use your HELOC to pay off your CC as needed. Credit Card will also return points on purchases.

Combine a HELOC, with a CC, and Mortgage to do a Velocity Banking Strategy. Open a HELOC, and use a huge chunk to pay off the mortgage principle (same property or another - the earlier the loan section the bigger the payoff). Keep a zero balance in your checking. Any day to day activities, use your CC to pay it off. At the end of the month use the HELOC to pay the CC balance. Any extra income goes toward paying down the HELOC balance. Get it to zero before the rate rises. Cancel, then open another HELOC at the introductory rate. Garret Taira perfected this strategy.
