Delayed Financing
================================

Refinancing

  If you are looking to take cash out with a conventional loan in the first 6 months of ownership then you will 
  have to meet the delayed financing guidelines. Main takeaways from delayed financing are
  - the value of the property will be capped at the purchase price even if the home appraised higher.
  - you will have to prove source of funds for the purchase
  - if you opened any new unsecured debt when purchasing the home then that debt must be paid off when cashing 
  out.
  If you wait 6 months then these requirements are waived


Look up "delayed financing". Some lenders will let you take out 70-75% of ARV or 100% of your purchase price and 
rehab cost, whichever is lower. You have to put your rehab in the HUD at time of title.

The Fannie Mae rule is 6 months. Some local banks and credit unions will allow sooner and hold the loan. 
Some lenders are longer because they have overlays to the Fannie guidelines. Delayed financing, if you have 
the rehab dollars on the HUD when you purchase is also a good option.

If none of those work because you don't qualify for one reason or another, go with a portfolio lender/broker.  
They often have lower to no seasoning requirements for cash out, generally to 75% loan to value of the new 
appraisal after the property is stabilized.
