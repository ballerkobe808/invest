Delayed Financing
================================

Refinancing

  If you are looking to take cash out with a conventional loan in the first 6 months of ownership then you will 
  have to meet the delayed financing guidelines. Main takeaways from delayed financing are
  - the value of the property will be capped at the purchase price even if the home appraised higher.
  - you will have to prove source of funds for the purchase
  - if you opened any new unsecured debt when purchasing the home then that debt must be paid off when cashing 
  out.
  If you wait 6 months then these requirements are waived
