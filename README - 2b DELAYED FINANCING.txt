Delayed Financing
================================

Refinancing

  If you are looking to take cash out with a conventional loan in the first 6 months of ownership then you will 
  have to meet the delayed financing guidelines. Main takeaways from delayed financing are
  - the value of the property will be capped at the purchase price even if the home appraised higher.
  - you will have to prove source of funds for the purchase
  - if you opened any new unsecured debt when purchasing the home then that debt must be paid off when cashing 
  out.
  If you wait 6 months then these requirements are waived


Look up "delayed financing". Some lenders will let you take out 70-75% of ARV or 100% of your purchase price and 
rehab cost, whichever is lower. You have to put your rehab in the HUD at time of title.

The Fannie Mae rule is 6 months. Some local banks and credit unions will allow sooner and hold the loan. 
Some lenders are longer because they have overlays to the Fannie guidelines. Delayed financing, if you have 
the rehab dollars on the HUD when you purchase is also a good option.

If none of those work because you don't qualify for one reason or another, go with a portfolio lender/broker.  
They often have lower to no seasoning requirements for cash out, generally to 75% loan to value of the new 
appraisal after the property is stabilized.


You can use YOUR OWN CASH, OR BORROWED CASH FROM A FRIEND
--------------------------------------------------------------
You just cant use hard money or an institutional lender


Example:
50k house, you buy it with 50k cash, it appraises for 80k, you get 50k cash back out, 
have a rental that cashflows every month AND have 30k in equity, rinse and repeat

Yes, you can use a HELOC with delayed financing and this will be required to be paid at closing of the refinance. 
Below is the information on guideline for Fannie Mae. Freddie Mac is similar except they require all borrowed funds 
to paid at the closing of refinance.

Delayed Financing Exception is an exception to 6 months seasoning of ownership by the borrower required on a 
cash-out refinance.
Current appraised value may be used to calculate LTV/CLTV/HCLTV.
Borrowers who purchased the subject property within the past six months (measured from the date on which the property 
was purchased to the disbursement date of the new mortgage loan) are eligible for a cash-out refinance if all of the 
following  requirements are met:o
The original purchase transaction was an arms-length transaction.
For the new refinance transaction, the borrower(s) must meet the borrower eligibility requirements of these guidelines 
(See Borrower Eligibility section). The borrower(s) may have initially purchased the property as one of the following:
A natural person
An eligible inter vivos revocable trust, when the borrower is both the individual establishing the trust 
and the beneficiary of the trust;
An eligible land trust when the borrower is the beneficiary of the land trust (new refinance loan cannot close 
in land trust); OR
An LLC or partnership in which the borrower(s) have an individual or joint ownership of 100% (new refinance 
loan cannot close in name of LLC or partnership)
The original purchase transaction is documented by the Settlement Statement, which confirms that no mortgage 
financing was used to obtain the subject property. (A recorded trusteeâ€™s deed [or similar alternative] confirming 
the amount paid by the grantee to trustee may be substituted for a Settlement Statement if a Settlement Statement 
was not provided to the purchaser at time of sale.)
The preliminary title search or report must not reflect any existing liens on the subject property.
The sources of funds for the purchase transaction are documented (such as bank statements, personal loan documents, 
or a HELOC on another property).
If the source of funds to acquire the property was an unsecured loan or a loan secured by an asset other than the 
subject property (such as a HELOC secured by another property), the Settlement Statement for the refinance 
transaction must reflect that all cash-out proceeds be used to pay off or pay down, if applicable, the loan 
used to purchase the property. Any payments on the balance remaining from the original loan must be included 
in the debt-to-income ratio calculation for the refinance transaction.
Funds received as gifts and used to purchase the property may not be reimbursed with proceeds of the new mortgage loan.
The new loan amount can be no more than the actual documented amount of the borrower's initial investment in 
purchasing the property plus the financing of closing costs, prepaid fees, and points on the new mortgage 
loan (subject to the maximum LTV/CLTV/HCLTV ratios for the cash-out transaction based on current appraised value).
All other cash-out refinance eligibility requirements are met. Cash-out pricing is applicable.


Including rehab in closing statement:
If you include on your closing statements (which vary state to state - HUD-1/ALTA statement ) the renovation costs - 
and have them charged at closing...... This renovation cost now becomes an initial closing cost and can be included 
with the max that you are able to pull out prior to 6 months. So this could also include the $40k in renovations 
allowing you to pull out up to $90k.
