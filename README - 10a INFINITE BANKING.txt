Term Life
-------------------------
Term life insurance provides coverage for a certain time period. 
It’s often called “pure life insurance” because it’s designed only to protect your dependents 
in case you die prematurely. If you have a term policy and die within the term, your beneficiaries 
receive the payout. The policy has no other value.

You choose the term when you buy the policy. Common terms are 10, 20 or 30 years. With most policies, 
the payout, called the death benefit, and the cost, or premium, stay the same throughout the term.

When you shop for term life:

Choose a term that coincides with the years you’ll be paying the bills and want life insurance 
coverage in case you die early.

Buy an amount your family would need if you were no longer there to provide for them. The payout 
could replace your income and help your family pay for services you perform now, such as child care.
Ideally, your family’s need for life insurance will end around the time the term expires: Your kids 
will be on their own, you’ll have paid off your house, and you’ll have plenty of money in savings to 
serve as a financial safety net.

All of the best life insurance companies sell term life, so it’s easy to find rates.




Whole Life
---------------------
Like all permanent life insurance policies, whole life provides lifelong coverage and includes an investment 
component known as the policy’s cash value. The cash value grows slowly, tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay 
taxes on its gains while they’re accumulating.

You can borrow money against the account or surrender the policy for the cash. But if you don’t repay policy 
loans with interest, you’ll reduce your death benefit, and if you surrender the policy, you’ll no longer have 
coverage.

Like all permanent life insurance policies, whole life provides lifelong coverage and includes an investment 
component.

Although it’s more complicated than term life insurance, whole life is the most straightforward form of 
permanent life insurance. Here’s why:

The premium remains the same for as long as you live
The death benefit is guaranteed
The cash value account grows at a guaranteed rate
Some whole life policies can also earn annual dividends, a portion of the insurer’s financial surplus. 
You can take the dividends in cash, leave them on deposit to earn interest or use them to decrease your 
premium, repay policy loans or buy additional coverage. Dividends are not guaranteed.
