### 1.0.1. PROCESS - Purchase and Closing on the property

NOTE: Save all documentation with everything you do in an organized way! This will make life easier in the future.

1. Submit Bid and reach an Agreement with Seller - Get it under Contract

   Work with a real estate agent. Put in an offer for the property through your real estate agent.
   Important! Ask for the seller to cover the closing costs, and offer a higher price to make up for it. Maxiumum amount allowed by an investment propert is 2% for a conventional loan. (6% for FHA)

   Get the counter offer and discuss with your agent or advisors. Submit a counter offer. Repeat the process until satisfied and you reach an agreement.

   Always add: Daniel, and/or assigns (you should always add this cuz it wont hurt, but can help) Different states may use diff verbage

2. Home Inspection
   Get an inspection - important to know what you are getting - about $300-$500.
   Work with seller/turnkey company to get things fixed that need to be.

3. Lender Appraisal
   Get an appraisal of the property (usually the lender will order this and its to keep themselves safe) If it comes back lower than expected, you are not obligated to buy it. I'm prolly paying for this - takes about a week.

4. Connect with the property manager -
   stay in touch with him - gotta give him banking info so he can send rents over to you. (figure out of its rented already, or to be rented - in that case its a target rent. 80% of the time its rented currently)

5. Do the Close.
   About 60-75 days from the time you sign the purchase agreement to the time you sign the closing documents. (up to 90 days) If its close to the closing date and its not close, then email your investment counselor. Communicate in a timely manner with: Turnkey Investment Counselor, Lender (or mortgage broker), Title Company

### Purchae to Wholesale

### Title Company Criteria

1. They are convenient

Home Inspection (300-500):

#### Lender/Loan related fees

- Lender Appraisal (300-650): Lender needs to make sure they can sell the house if you default on your loan - they send in their own appraiser to get the value - this can vary from appraiser to appraiser. May need to go back again - that is an additional 200-400 per visit.

### Contract to Buy --------------------

Whoever controls the contract, controls the deal, and outcome

PURCHASE & SALE AGREEMENT FOR REAL ESTATE -
Certain states have ammendments that need to be added
Realtors want their contract involved - but its better to use yours - make sure the realtors know they will get their full commission
Draw a line over their contract, initial, and write "See Addendum"

NOTES:

1. Add "And/Or Assigns" to your buyer name (Just in case you might need it)
2. EXACT LEGAL DESCRIPTION TO FOLLOW - Add in all the things that will be included with the property, line by line - refrigerator, stove, dishwasher, washer, dryer, all curtain hardware, HVAC, ceiling fans, light fixtures, etc. Add some extra things (like 50 in flat screen TV, mower, etc) so you have room to barter. Make sure the house isn't stripped clean when they leave. Putting things in here could save you a lot of headaches of things that need to be replaced later. These can be in an addendum. Include the appliances model and serial number of everything (appliances) Take video to validate what was there.
3. 1st out - New Loan (Subject to:) Put in a .25% loan rate lower than what you are approved for so you have an out.
4. Dont use an ARM loan (in case the rates get jacked up later)
5. 2nd out - New Loan (Subject to:) Put in 2 points max for the closing cost
6. New Loan (Put a month for how long the loan will take to approve - you have wiggle room to negotiate now)
7. Get HOA Bylaws in order to know what is required - some will make you want to walk
8. The buyer max extend the closing date by 30 days by paying 1000 in cash - another built in safety measure
9. Possession - you will hold 15% of his profits until he's met the terms of your agreement, and also will be paying daily for each day of issue. The contract will help you in case the seller doesn't do his part
10. 3rd out - Special Stipulations - "This contract is contingent upon buyers/partners inspection and approval within 10 business days of ratification"
11. Always do a title search the day of closing - in case the title changed. Call them the day before and let them know you will do a title search and ask them to pull it in the morning so you dont have to wait.
