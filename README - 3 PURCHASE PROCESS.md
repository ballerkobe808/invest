### 1.0.1. PROCESS - Purchase and Closing on the property

NOTE: Save all documentation with everything you do in an organized way! This will make life easier in the future.

1. Submit Bid and reach an Negotiate with Seller - Get it under Contract!!!

   Work with a real estate agent. Usually better to use a realtor vs trying to save the seller money. Safer for you, and good deals usually aren't dependent on the seller getting the absolute lowest price.
   Important!

   Things to add to the purchase agreement:

   1. Subject to Home Inspection
   2. Subject to Lender Terms (Note: dont put too many subject tos and scare the seller away)
   3. Get a list of things that will stay w the property (Refrigerator, Stove, etc). Be as Comprehensive as possible.
   4. Seller to cover 2% of closing costs. (2% is max for inv property, 6% for FHA)
   5. Ernest money to hold the property usually

   Always add: Daniel, and/or assigns (you should always add this cuz it wont hurt, but can help) Different states may use diff verbage

2. Home Inspection
   Get an inspection - important to know what you are getting - about $300-$600.

3. Lender Appraisal
   Lender will require this to loan you money - usually you pay for this. \$300-500. If it comes back lower than expected, you will have to cover the diff or ask the seller to drop the price.

4. Connect with the property manager -
   Get a property manager lined up, interviewed and ready to go when its time. Leases, terms, and a feel for the company are important here.

5. Close.
   About 60-75 days from the time you sign the purchase agreement to the time you sign the closing documents. (up to 90 days) Communicate in a timely manner with everyone!

### Purchase to Wholesale

Build a buyers database
Go to auctions and pass out your card to be on a mailing list
Go to lowes/home depot early in the morning and get investors contact to forward emails
REI Meetings

assign or use a transactional lender - simultaneous close not allowed in a lot of states

### Title Company Criteria

1. They are convenient
2. They do simultanous closes (This is required for no money down technique)
3. Ask "Do you have a licensed intermediary that is staffed here at this office"?

### Closing Costs --------------------------

These can run anywhere from 2k - 10k+ Depending on what(and who) is involved

#### Lender/Loan related fees

- Lender Appraisal (300-650): Lender needs to make sure they can sell the house if you default on your loan - they send in their own appraiser to get the value - this can vary from appraiser to appraiser. May need to go back again - that is an additional 200-400 per visit.
- Application fee (25-1000): Cost to process your loan - This may be inclusive, or it may be broken up into: Application fee, , Settlement Fee, Document Fee - basically BS haha.
- Credit Check (25): Pay to check your credit.
- Notary Fee (200): Pay for a Notary.
- Courier Fee (50): This covers the cost of transporting documents to complete the loan transaction as quickly as possible.
- Assumption fee: If you take over the remaining balance of the sellers mortgage you have to pay a fee??
- Attorney, Closing, or Escrow Fee(0-1000): title company, escrow company or attorney for conducting the closing. Certain states require an attorney present at closing.
- Prepaid Interest: Lender is gonna charge you for the interest accruing between settlement date and your first mortgage payment
- Loan Origination fee (1000-3000): Big up front fee by the lender to pay for underwriting, admin, and processing, can cover attorney fees, notaries, doc prep, etc. Average 1-2% of the loan.
- Points (1000-5000): Pay the interest on the front end to reduce the interest rate. Example: 100,000 - 1 point = 1000, to reducee your interest rate by one point.
- Mortgage Broker fee (1000-3000): If you are going through a mortgage broker to connect you with a lender, they will charge a fee. 1-2% of the home's purchase price. Don't use a broker!!

- Lenders title insurace: Lenders buy insurace in case there was an error in the title search and someone else owns the property.
- Owners title insurace: Protect yourself in case there was an error in the title search.

#### Property taxes and insurance (Prepaid fees that you would have to pay in the future anyway - Not really closing costs)

- Annual assessments: Condos or Homeowners association sometimes requires the first years fee upfront
- Homeowners insurance premium (Hazard Insurance) (800): Usually the lender makes you get Homeowners Insurace. You pay the first month/months/year premium up front.
- Property Taxes(50-1000): Pay the first x number of months up front.

#### Mortgage Insurace Fees - If you put down less than 20%, you gotta pay Mortgage Insurace.

- Mortgage insurance application fee: Just a processing fee to apply.
- Upfront mortgage insurance: May need to pay PMI upfront depending on your lender.
- FHA, VA and USDA fees: Fees vary depending who is guaranteeing your mortgage.

### Contract to Buy --------------------

Whoever controls the contract, controls the deal, and outcome

PURCHASE & SALE AGREEMENT FOR REAL ESTATE -
Certain states have ammendments that need to be added
Realtors want their contract involved - but its better to use yours - make sure the realtors know they will get their full commission
Draw a line over their contract, initial, and write "See Addendum"

NOTES:

1. Add "And/Or Assigns" to your buyer name (Just in case you might need it)
2. EXACT LEGAL DESCRIPTION TO FOLLOW - Add in all the things that will be included with the property, line by line - refrigerator, stove, dishwasher, washer, dryer, all curtain hardware, HVAC, ceiling fans, light fixtures, etc. Add some extra things (like 50 in flat screen TV, mower, etc) so you have room to barter. Make sure the house isn't stripped clean when they leave. Putting things in here could save you a lot of headaches of things that need to be replaced later. These can be in an addendum. Include the appliances model and serial number of everything (appliances) Take video to validate what was there.
3. 1st out - New Loan (Subject to:) Put in a .25% loan rate lower than what you are approved for so you have an out.
4. Dont use an ARM loan (in case the rates get jacked up later)
5. 2nd out - New Loan (Subject to:) Put in 2 points max for the closing cost
6. New Loan (Put a month for how long the loan will take to approve - you have wiggle room to negotiate now)
7. Get HOA Bylaws in order to know what is required - some will make you want to walk
8. The buyer max extend the closing date by 30 days by paying 1000 in cash - another built in safety measure
9. Possession - you will hold 15% of his profits until he's met the terms of your agreement, and also will be paying daily for each day of issue. The contract will help you in case the seller doesn't do his part
10. 3rd out - Special Stipulations - "This contract is contingent upon buyers/partners inspection and approval within 10 business days of ratification"
11. Always do a title search the day of closing - in case the title changed. Call them the day before and let them know you will do a title search and ask them to pull it in the morning so you dont have to wait.
