Red Flags
1. They dont pull permits
2. If you ask "What are you good at?" And they say "everything" - nobody can be good at everything

Up and coming neighborhoods

Irvington - rents going Up
Little Flower?
Speedway maybe...



Mile square - 1800/1900s, then each mile out gets to be around 10 years
outer ring is around 1960s - this will affect the home style
40s/50s brick, then went away

Lots of "military" homes 3/1 cookie cutter homes on slabs - before had a crawl or basement

Security Deposits in Indianapolis
-What Can I Keep the Security Deposit For?
===================================================
Obviously, there are certain instances where you can deduct all or part of the Security Deposit from the Tenant. 
The official law states that Landlords in Indiana may keep Security Deposits for the following purposes:

1. To reimburse the landlord for actual damages to the rental unit or any ancillary facility that are not 
the result of ordinary wear and tear.

2. To pay the landlord for: 
(A) all rent in arrearage under the rental agreement; and 
(B) rent due for premature termination of the rental agreement by the tenant.

3. To pay for the last payment period of a residential rental agreement if a written agreement between 
the landlord and the tenant stipulates that the security deposit will serve as the last payment of rent due.

4. To reimburse the landlord for utility or sewer charges paid by the landlord that are: 
(A) the obligation of the tenant under the rental agreement; and 
(B) unpaid by the tenant

So, while there is some good guidance here, there is a lot left to interpretation as well, 
especially when assessing what is "normal wear and tear."
This is where you will need to construct your Lease with exactly what you expect when the Tenant leaves. 
Should the carpets be professionally cleaned? Should the house be fully cleaned?

Further, you will need to adopt some standards on certain items like paint and flooring. 
If a Tenant lives in your property for 3 years and the home needs painted upon move-out, 
should the Tenant bear any of this responsibility? These are important and tricky considerations that 
you need to determine as soon as you decide to become a Landlord.

### How Do I Refund the Deposit?
------------------------------------
Again, it’s state-driven. In Indiana, you have 45 days after the lease end date and the Tenant has 
vacated to return the deposit in full or provide a letter noting what deductions were made from 
that Security Deposit.

If you’ve read my previous blog on wear and tear, this is where that information becomes 
business-man-3160009_1920.jpgextremely important. If your security deposit is $1,000 and 
you feel like the Tenant did $200 of damage outside of normal wear and tear, you’ll need 
to refund the $800 within 45 days and provide documentation on how that $200 was spent.

### What if I Don't Refund the Security Deposit within 45 days?
---------------------------------------------------------------------
If you, as the Landlord, fail to return the deposit or send a letter itemizing what the deposit was 
used for within the allotted 45 days, then you leave yourself open for a lawsuit.

The Tenant has the right to sue you in small claims court for the full amount of the deposit and 
you will be forced to claim that no damages are due, with the exception of unpaid rent.

As a Landlord in Indiana, you don't have a ton of guidance on the matter of security deposits. 
You can combat this by 
A) Knowing and understanding what laws Indiana does have regarding security deposits and 
B) Developing a system and process that you will adhere to consistently from Tenant to Tenant.

Remember, the security deposit is the Tenant's money.
