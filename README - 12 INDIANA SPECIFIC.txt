Red Flags
1. They dont pull permits
2. If you ask "What are you good at?" And they say "everything" - nobody can be good at everything

Irvington - rents going Up
Little Flower?
Speedway maybe...



Mile square - 1800/1900s, then each mile out gets to be around 10 years
outer ring is around 1960s - this will affect the home style
40s/50s brick, then went away

Lots of "military" homes 3/1 cookie cutter homes on slabs - before had a crawl or basement

70/80/90s outside 465 loop
