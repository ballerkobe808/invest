Speedway maybe...

Mile square - 1800/1900s, then each mile out gets to be around 10 years
outer ring is around 1960s - this will affect the home style
40s/50s brick, then went away

Lots of "military" homes 3/1 cookie cutter homes on slabs - before had a crawl or basement

Bigger Pockets Indianapolis Neighborhoods
----------------------------------
Random Investor:
Fountain Square - up and coming hot area

Liv Indy:
SoBro - Liv Indy says it is gentrifying - could be huge in 5 years

Random Investor:
I like the areas surrounding Fountain square because I think they will see revitalization as 
FS gets more expensive and prices people out. For example, Bater-Hendricks and west of Woodruff place.
A bit of a more suburban market would be Lawrence and Perry township. Although suburban Lawrence also 
has some pretty tough areas.
I tend to have stay-away zones for example North: between 30th and 38th, east/west between Crown Hill 
and Fall Creek.

High Return Real Estate (Jack Gibson):
C class on the East side like Washington st., New York, Capital, Euclid (to name just a few) is where the 
ROI is going to be strongest, as long as you have great property management, and price to rent ratio is 
strong, you'll be in good shape in a lot of areas, there are no war zones in Indy.

Californian Investor:
Fountain square is a great area. Carmel and Fishers are going through tons of development also.
Beech Grove is a great rental area, very old-timey feel and great renters in my experience.

Pinnacle Investment Properties (Mike D'Arrigo ):
There are several good B and C class neighborhoods. I like a lot of the areas in the Warren and Lawrence 
townships and although most of those areas are fine, some are better than others so you really have to 
know the neighborhoods. You really won't find anything below C class in these areas and you'll find some 
nice B class areas. I particularly like the area south of 30th St and north of 10th St between Arlington 
on the west and N. German Church on the east. I also like the Devington area between 42nd on the south 
side and 46th to the north and Emerson on the west and Arlington on the east. There's a lot of other good 
areas too but you have to be careful. Indianapolis can vary neighborhood to neighborhood and even street 
to street. We sell turn keys in Indy and know the area well. Feel free to reach out if you'd like more insight.

Ross Denman:
Are you looking for long-term rentals or short-term holds. If you are looking for a 5 year investment 
in the up and coming areas... follow the historic districts.

Fountain Square
Irvington
Fall Creek
Little Flower Parish
Windsor Place
Highland Park
Brookside
Tuxedo Park
St Claire Place

There's really more than can be listed. Be sure to have someone drive the street and ensure that you are 
not purchasing in a ghost town though. While it's getting better, there are still streets in Indy where 
all but 3 or 4 homes are boarded up, abandoned, and/or owned by the city. These are very difficult properties 
to do anything with.

The "short-term hold" strategy is to do a rental rehab and tenant it for about 5 years. It's not a big 
money maker, but it will wash it's face. As soon as the area comes up enough... wait until your tenant 
moves out (or don't renew their lease) and do an extensive rehab and sell the home and 200-300% of what 
you have in it. I've seen this done a few times in Fountain Square. I know of people who had amazing deals 
in Irvington and will probably sell a house that they have less than $100k in and will sell it for over $200k.

If you are looking for your standard long-term rentals, the most common ones are going to be the 1960's-1970's 
ranches in Lawrence and Warren areas on the East Side or Eagledale on the West Side. I prefer Eagledale to 
Lawrence, but they're not that different as far as market rates, maintenance, rental rates, tenant demographic, 
etc.

I would recommend targeting homes that will rent for at least \$800/mo and have at least 1.5 baths. A study 
that we did last year shows that we are having considerably higher tenant retention on homes with more than 
1 bathroom. Families seem to outgrow bathroom space faster than anything
We manage several rentals in Fountain Square and it's amazing with everything that has been done there, but 
I feel that it may be in a bubble. It's hard to find "well-priced" deals and while the area is appreciating 
like crazy, I am not sure that it can continue much further before being over valued.

With that being said, the new tech jobs coming in to the downtown landscape is a huge catalyst for the 
restorations of the historic neighborhoods. These young professionals love these beautiful homes. 
There are some great opportunities to be had just outside of the FS area. There is a lot of activity in 
Bates-Hendricks, Windsor Place, Highland Park, etc. The near East Side (St Claire Place) is starting to 
come along but it's still another year or so before it sees any sustainable changes.

Typically, the neighborhoods get better north of 56th St anywhere across town. 52nd St isn't too bad though. 
The worst places in Lawrence are going to be around 38th St and 42nd St. I would look that the crime map 
for that specific area. I use Trulia for this. I would also ensure that the rent will be $750/mo+ and 
even better if it is $800/mo. That will put you on the higher end for the area.

Random Investor:
The list of prospective neighborhoods hasn't changed. I live in Broad Ripple and ride my bicycle everywhere. 
Another one to check out is Tarkington Park. It's near 38th street (pretty rough) but I'm seeing good changes.

N Post Road has notoriously bad crime. Rental rates will be around \$500-800 max.

30th street to 42nd street and N Franklin Rd to N German Church Rd.? one of the most dangerous areas of 
the city. Type in “police shootout post road Indianapolis” and look at how many different incidents come up. 
this area has a bad reputation due to a couple of apartments on the corners of Post and 38th and Post and 42nd. 
The further east that you move from Post, the lower the crime. These are lower income neighborhoods but the 
typical rents will be $750-$800.

In my opinon the 38th Street and Meridian, N Post Rd, 16th Street and Tibbs, and Washington Park neighborhood 
are the most dangerous.

Bate Hendricks neighborhood is often featured on the HGTV show Good Bones, as are the neighboring areas of 
Fountain Square and Old Southside.
Bates Hendricks is the neighborhood of the year in Indy as far as gentrification is concerned. 
Bates-Hendricks is easily between a C-D area right now. It is coming back and with the explosion of growth in 
Fountain Square there are some good deals.

on Sutherland Ave. there are houses in the range of 300-500k. Two streets over, but still in the same 
neighborhood, houses are 40-80k.
That being said, some oareas that you will typically do well in are Broad Ripple, Carmel, Fishers, 
Westfield, Zionsville.

Right now our team is excited about the development in these neighborhoods:
Twin Aire
Christian Park
South Fountain Square
East Fountain Square
Arsenal Heights
Mapleton Fall Creek
King Park
Friends and Neighbors
Garfield Park
Bates-Hendricks (it's still possible to find a deal here but it's quickly becoming saturated)

### High Return Real Estate - Indiana

We chose Indy because of the opportunity.... not so much for the appreciation, but because Indy has SO 
MANY things going for it for investors...

- low prices

- very good price-to-rent-ratios in the B class neighborhoods, and fantastic price-to-rent-ratios in the 
C class neighborhoods,

- low property taxes

- very landlord friendly laws

- major city with good transportation, good infrastructure, and solid employment

Notice that appreciation is not on the above list. That said, Indy is going through somewhat of a 
renaissance... there are pockets that are going crazy, but we are so focused on squeezing the most 
ROI/cash flow that we don't really worry about appreciation. Oh sure, we will buy next to gentrifying 
areas, and get some bleed-over. But, appreciation is ONLY meaningful when you sell or refi.

If you're doing Buy/Hold, there's not a better city in the country to do it... but you can't put 
appreciation into your numbers...it's conjecture/speculation, and you're doing yourself a disservice 
if you're using those numbers in your calcs for a buy/hold purchase.






==================================================
Security Deposits in Indianapolis
-What Can I Keep the Security Deposit For?
===================================================
Obviously, there are certain instances where you can deduct all or part of the Security Deposit from the Tenant. 
The official law states that Landlords in Indiana may keep Security Deposits for the following purposes:

1. To reimburse the landlord for actual damages to the rental unit or any ancillary facility that are not 
the result of ordinary wear and tear.

2. To pay the landlord for: 
(A) all rent in arrearage under the rental agreement; and 
(B) rent due for premature termination of the rental agreement by the tenant.

3. To pay for the last payment period of a residential rental agreement if a written agreement between 
the landlord and the tenant stipulates that the security deposit will serve as the last payment of rent due.

4. To reimburse the landlord for utility or sewer charges paid by the landlord that are: 
(A) the obligation of the tenant under the rental agreement; and 
(B) unpaid by the tenant

So, while there is some good guidance here, there is a lot left to interpretation as well, 
especially when assessing what is "normal wear and tear."
This is where you will need to construct your Lease with exactly what you expect when the Tenant leaves. 
Should the carpets be professionally cleaned? Should the house be fully cleaned?

Further, you will need to adopt some standards on certain items like paint and flooring. 
If a Tenant lives in your property for 3 years and the home needs painted upon move-out, 
should the Tenant bear any of this responsibility? These are important and tricky considerations that 
you need to determine as soon as you decide to become a Landlord.

------------------------------------
How Do I Refund the Deposit?
------------------------------------
Again, it’s state-driven. In Indiana, you have 45 days after the lease end date and the Tenant has 
vacated to return the deposit in full or provide a letter noting what deductions were made from 
that Security Deposit.

If you’ve read my previous blog on wear and tear, this is where that information becomes 
business-man-3160009_1920.jpgextremely important. If your security deposit is $1,000 and 
you feel like the Tenant did $200 of damage outside of normal wear and tear, you’ll need 
to refund the $800 within 45 days and provide documentation on how that $200 was spent.

### What if I Don't Refund the Security Deposit within 45 days?
---------------------------------------------------------------------
If you, as the Landlord, fail to return the deposit or send a letter itemizing what the deposit was 
used for within the allotted 45 days, then you leave yourself open for a lawsuit.

The Tenant has the right to sue you in small claims court for the full amount of the deposit and 
you will be forced to claim that no damages are due, with the exception of unpaid rent.

As a Landlord in Indiana, you don't have a ton of guidance on the matter of security deposits. 
You can combat this by 
A) Knowing and understanding what laws Indiana does have regarding security deposits and 
B) Developing a system and process that you will adhere to consistently from Tenant to Tenant.

Remember, the security deposit is the Tenant's money.

Gifts for Indiana Team
------------------------------------

Taylor's Bakery or Long's Donuts has really good sweets. Everyone in Indianapolis knows about it.

My Sugar Pie in Zionsville, IN has nationally renowned pies. 
You can set them up to receive a whole pie or to have them receive a pie a month for 3 months. 
My clients loved them. You can have them do all of the shipping etc.

I sent a package from Omaha Steak for about \$90 to both my realtor and PM for xmas last year.
