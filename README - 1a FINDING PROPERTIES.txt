# FINDING PROPERTIES

Always be on the lookout.
Keep learning and collecting data points - helps you to internalize value and recognize deals quickly.
Most important is finding the deal - deals are made WHEN YOU BUY!

### How to find Value

There has to be a reason why you can get the house at under market value. Be aware of this!
Keys to a property you want:

1. The house needs upgrade/repair/Foreclosing/Bank owned and wants to unload
2. The owner is motivated to sell under market value
3. It is in an area of town where people want to live (there will be demand to rent/buy later)

### Rental Portfolio

- Single/Multifamily Rentals with over 1.2% Rent to Value ratio.
- Be aware of too good to be true 2% RtV - often bad neighborhoods and not worth the headache - tip from experienced investors - also beware maint costs - same price for new HVAC in 50k and 100k house
- Solid Property Management - either in place or able to connect with some (So important! This is a make or break aspect - can make life terrible or awesome later)
- Great Locations!! This is very important. I want somewhere that people will want to rent, and that will be easy to manage. One eviction = thousands in damage, vacancy, legal fees, etc. Don't just look at spreadsheet numbers

### PROCESS - Finding New Agents

Look on Zillow (Zillow.com/agent-finder.) or Yelp and send an email to the agent with the following information:

1. That you are an investor who understands real estate
2. What specifically you are looking for
3. How you intend to purchase (loan, cash, and so on)
4. How you heard about the agent

Sample Email:

Hello! My name is Daniel and I'm a real estate investor from Hawaii. I've been doing some research to determine the best place for me to start buying rentals to hold long term for cashflow and that has led me to Indianapolis. I've found that you are one of the top-producing agents in the area. I'd love to chat sometime and see if you would be able to help me out.

I'm looking for either:

1. A single-family home in a good neighborhood with modest cashflow in the 100-160k range OR
2. A multifamily property in a relatively low crime neighborhood with excellent cashflow in the 30-70k range.

I'm looking to purchase at least one property by the end of the year, and 1-2 properties each year after that. I also have some friends who would be interested in investing as well in the next year or so. My goal is to find properties that I can purchase below market value with conventional financing. If you have a preferred lender, I would like to get pre-approved with him or her as well. Also, if you have a property manager that you would recommend, I'd love to start reaching out to him/her as well.

I see that you have a really great reputation, and hope that we can develop a relationship that will be profitable for both of us in the future. Thank you for your time!

Daniel

![](lib/Letter-to-Prospective-Realtor-Agents.png)

Sort through agents, and find one that will be able to bring you good deals. Also look at it from his/her point of view too. What is he/she getting - will you be doing a lot of business, bringing business their way?Rewarding them with extra compensation or helping them out too? Be aware of what value u bring to the transaction.

### Foreclosures

1. Preforeclosure. The property is listed to be sold at a public auction. Investors can purchase directly from the seller during the preforeclosure period.

2. Public Auction. The property iss put up for public auction, usually at the county courthouse. Investors bid on the property.

3. Real Estate Owned. If the property doesn't sell at auction, it goes back to the lender. Investors can purchase the property from the lender.

Sources of Foreclosures and Auctions:

- U.S Dept of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
- Veterans Administration (VA)
- Federal Housing Authority (FHA)
- Federal National Mortgage Insurance Association (Fannie Mae)
- Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac)
- IRS
- Property Tax Sales (check your local taxing authority)

### Probate

Deal of the Decade in Essentials goes over this

### Tips

Reward the people who bring you deals!
Look for win-win relationships

### 1.2.2.1. PROCESS - Assess the Neighborhoods Desirability

Targeting neighborhoods helps you get to know how to spot a deal/interact with it

Rehabbing criteria:

1. Proximity to your house/travel time.
2. Selling prices of the homes in the neighborhood (higher better)
3. Sales activity of the homes in the neighborhood (higher better). If low days on market, high demand, people are moving in. High days on market, low demand, people moving out.
4. Ages of the homes in the neighborhood (too new is bad, too old is bad)
5. Appeal and charm of the neighborhood (homeowner pride)
6. Safety of the neighborhood

Rental criteria:

1. Population makeup - ethnicity, age, demographics, crime, growing, etc
2. Job market diversified? (If a big company pulls out of the area, will jobs be lost?)
3. New companies moving in or out soon? Any big events trending soon?
4. Housing market - Are prices going up? Look for a low foreclosure %
5. Look for a low cost of living.
6. What is the vacancy rate of the city?
7. Any special conditions? Flood zone, or hurricane prone (Florida, etc)

### PROCESS - Assess Property Value (ARV)

1. Get the Comps. Ask agent to run a CMA (Comparative Market Analysys) report. Based on:

   1. Within the past 6 months
   2. Close proximity
   3. Similar size (sq feet)
   4. Similar Layout (2 bed 1 bath)
   5. Similar year built

2. Drive to the Comps and use your eyes. See if they're better or worse than your property using:

   1. Condition. Roof, garage doors, windows, driveway, walkways, porches
   2. Curb Appeal. The architecute, trees, lawn, landscaping, lot size, and grade
   3. View. Water, city skyline, mountains, any eyesores
   4. Street. Cul-de-sac, major street, major intersecion, pride of ownership evident
   5. Proximity to Infrastructure. Commercial businesses, factories, undesirable establishments, highways, power lines, parking lots, bus stops etc.

3. Read the Market. Today, 6 month forecast? Some things to consider are:

   1. Mortgate rate trends. Are rates going up or down in next 6 months? Higher rates drop home prices
   2. Seasonal buying cylcle. Home sales usually take a dip during winter months, but pick up in the summer.
   3. Time on market. Ask realtor for time on market - average time sitting - slow or fast
   4. Developments. Anything that will cause people to want to move in or leave? Major employers, schools, stores, churches, parks, pools, entertainment value

4. Check with Experts. Check with local experts. Some to consider are:

   1. Neighborhood Realtors. Agents who specialize in that neighborhood.
   2. Appraisers. Get an actual appraisal (\$300-500). See if you can just get a verbal appraisal for a discount. Let them know you are looking for the ARV, not current condition.
   3. Neighborhod Residents. Talk to people who live there.

### Interview Turnkey/Owner

Find out what the turnkey provider or owner is like. Big question is if you can trust them. Lots of times just trying to gauge that - competency and trust.

- WHY ARE YOU SELLING? Figure this out to see if you can come up with a creative way for a win-win

Questions

- [Reputation on Bigger Pockets]
- Start with open-ended questions and just try to let them talk - get a gauge on them
- Can you tell me more about your company?
- What is your role in the process? Buy? Rehab? Sell? Property Management? Why are you selling?
- How do you vet your actual providers? (if they have some)
- Ask them "What separates you from other companies?"
- Can you send me the rent rolls, of current/previous tenants
- What kind of shape is the property in? Has any work been done recently? Do you have any documentation of that?

- Do you own the property? If not, who is the company/person who is selling it? Always better selling their own
- Was the property rehabbed? Who did the rehab? Always better to know the rehab workmanship personally
- Does it currently need any repairs? If so, what do you think the estimated costs will be?
- Can you tell me a little more about the neighborhood (want them to describe it in their own terms)
- Big 6 Cap Exp Questions - Find facts and also get a feel on how they answer. Ask Hey ball park numbers, what would it cost to redo the roof, etc - just to get a feel. 1 Roof, 2 HVAC, 3 Foundation, 4 Plumbing, 5 Electrical, 6 Termites

### Questions for a Turnkey Company

1.  Does your company own the turnkey properties you are selling or are you a marketer?
    You will find that many “turnkey sellers” are actually just marketers selling actual turnkey providers properties. These marketers typically mark up the price of the property a little but so they can get a piece of the pie. There is no sense in working with a marketer when you can go direct to a turnkey provider and cut costs and time. Cut out the middleman!!

2.  How long have you been in business as a turnkey seller?
    The longer they have been in business the better. There are many new providers popping out left and right and although this isn’t necessarily a bad thing, having more experience selling turnkeys will lead to a more efficient and better experience when buying.

3.  Do you own any rentals in the same neighborhoods you’re selling in? Do you stand by your product?
    It would be a good sign if the turnkey provider invests in their own properties and has their own portfolio of rental investments in the same locale they are selling. If not, this could be a red flag.

4.  How many markets/cities do you sell in?
    Multiple cities and markets could mean the turnkey seller does not own the properties themselves and are a marketer. What I’ve found is the best turnkey sellers only offer properties where they live.

5.  How many out of state investors do you work with?
    Do you have any investor referrals I can speak to first hand that have acquired 1 or more of your turnkeys?
    You are looking for a team that has experience catering to out of state investors. If they cannot provide referrals of previous customers to talk to than that is a red flag.

6.  What types of neighborhoods do you purchase/sell properties in? A, B, C, D classes?
    The best turnkey properties typically fall in either the B or C class properties. A’s are usually too expensive and there is no cash flow. D’s are high crime areas which you don’t want.

7.  What is the rehab process like on each property? What items are replaced?
    Ideally the properties provided from the turnkey provider should include a new rehab with all new or newer mechanical’s including roof, HVAC, water heater, updated electrical, and updated plumbing.

8.  Can I fly out and take a tour of your operation and view available properties?
    It is highly recommended that you do fly out there and visit the company you are wanting to work with. You need to see firsthand how they operate, who they are, and more importantly the quality of the properties they have and locale. Nothing says more than seeing it for yourself. If they don’t provide this, run! To read about my experience flying out and doing just this, read here.

9.  Do you provide a home warranty for the first year?
    Most turnkey providers will give you a first year’s home warranty which will replace any of the newly replaced items free of charge if they go out on you. Nice to have!

10. Do you allow lender financing for purchasing your turnkeys?
    A legit and reputable turnkey provider will allow you to provide your own conventional financing. This is a big deal because using conventional financing means an independent appraisal is required. This covers your butt to make sure you are not over paying for the turnkey. You should be expecting to pay no more than market value for whatever turnkey property you are interested in. If a turnkey seller won’t allow an appraisal, run! Even if they tell you that they only accept cash offers because the properties sell so quickly. They will always say this when they don’t allow financing. Just find another company!
    If a turnkey seller won’t allow an appraisal, run!

11) Do you offer any rental or maintenance guarantees?
    Some turnkey providers will offer a guarantee of some sort. Take this as a warning as this is really more of a sales gimmick. If they do say yes, ask them if it applies when it really matters like years 2 – 4.

12) Will the turnkey property be fully occupied with a tenant before closing?
    A true turnkey company will provide property management, fill the vacancy and have an already cash flowing property for you at the time of closing.

13) Do the properties come with appliances? (Fridge, Stove)
    Some turnkey providers do not supply this and you are caught off guard toward the end of the process and will have to cough up more money for these two items. This does however vary by locale so be sure to do research to find out of this is common to not include these appliances.

14) Can you provide a step by step process of what the turnkey purchasing is like with your company?
    They should be able to provide to you a rundown of all the steps involved when purchasing a turnkey from the first step to the last step. It is very good to hear this as you’re not caught with any surprises during the process.

15) Do you provide property management in-house or outsource to a 3rd party?
    Regardless the answer to this one, there is a whole set of property management questions that need to be asked to whoever the property manager will be. It is preferred that they have the property management team in-house in my opinion, as they will provide you better service since they know they will be dealing with you in the future and are vested in this property. See property management questions below. To see the top 10 qualities for a property management company, click here.

The questions above are specifically for the turnkey provider and how they operate. The questions below are meant toward the property management aspect of the turnkey business. Some turnkey companies will provide their own property management through a different company they own or they will outsource the property management to a 3rd party in which they have a partnership with. Either way works however be sure to ask the property management team the questions below.

### Indianapolis Neighborhoods

Random Investor:
Fountain Square - up and coming hot area

Liv Indy:
SoBro - Liv Indy says it is gentrifying - could be huge in 5 years

Random Investor:
I like the areas surrounding Fountain square because I think they will see revitalization as FS gets more expensive and prices people out. For example, Bater-Hendricks and west of Woodruff place. A bit of a more suburban market would be Lawrence and Perry township. Although suburban Lawrence also has some pretty tough areas.
I tend to have stay-away zones for example North: between 30th and 38th, east/west between Crown Hill and Fall Creek.

High Return Real Estate (Jack Gibson):
C class on the East side like Washington st., New York, Capital, Euclid (to name just a few) is where the ROI is going to be strongest, as long as you have great property management, and price to rent ratio is strong, you'll be in good shape in a lot of areas, there are no war zones in Indy.

Californian Investor:
Fountain square is a great area. Carmel and Fishers are going through tons of development also.
Beech Grove is a great rental area, very old-timey feel and great renters in my experience.

Pinnacle Investment Properties (Mike D'Arrigo ):
There are several good B and C class neighborhoods. I like a lot of the areas in the Warren and Lawrence townships and although most of those areas are fine, some are better than others so you really have to know the neighborhoods. You really won't find anything below C class in these areas and you'll find some nice B class areas. I particularly like the area south of 30th St and north of 10th St between Arlington on the west and N. German Church on the east. I also like the Devington area between 42nd on the south side and 46th to the north and Emerson on the west and Arlington on the east. There's a lot of other good areas too but you have to be careful. Indianapolis can vary neighborhood to neighborhood and even street to street. We sell turn keys in Indy and know the area well. Feel free to reach out if you'd like more insight.

Ross Denman:
Are you looking for long-term rentals or short-term holds. If you are looking for a 5 year investment in the up and coming areas... follow the historic districts.

Fountain Square
Irvington
Fall Creek
Little Flower Parish
Windsor Place
Highland Park
Brookside
Tuxedo Park
St Claire Place

There's really more than can be listed. Be sure to have someone drive the street and ensure that you are not purchasing in a ghost town though. While it's getting better, there are still streets in Indy where all but 3 or 4 homes are boarded up, abandoned, and/or owned by the city. These are very difficult properties to do anything with.

The "short-term hold" strategy is to do a rental rehab and tenant it for about 5 years. It's not a big money maker, but it will wash it's face. As soon as the area comes up enough... wait until your tenant moves out (or don't renew their lease) and do an extensive rehab and sell the home and 200-300% of what you have in it. I've seen this done a few times in Fountain Square. I know of people who had amazing deals in Irvington and will probably sell a house that they have less than $100k in and will sell it for over $200k.

If you are looking for your standard long-term rentals, the most common ones are going to be the 1960's-1970's ranches in Lawrence and Warren areas on the East Side or Eagledale on the West Side. I prefer Eagledale to Lawrence, but they're not that different as far as market rates, maintenance, rental rates, tenant demographic, etc.

I would recommend targeting homes that will rent for at least \$800/mo and have at least 1.5 baths. A study that we did last year shows that we are having considerably higher tenant retention on homes with more than 1 bathroom. Families seem to outgrow bathroom space faster than anything
We manage several rentals in Fountain Square and it's amazing with everything that has been done there, but I feel that it may be in a bubble. It's hard to find "well-priced" deals and while the area is appreciating like crazy, I am not sure that it can continue much further before being over valued.

With that being said, the new tech jobs coming in to the downtown landscape is a huge catalyst for the restorations of the historic neighborhoods. These young professionals love these beautiful homes. There are some great opportunities to be had just outside of the FS area. There is a lot of activity in Bates-Hendricks, Windsor Place, Highland Park, etc. The near East Side (St Claire Place) is starting to come along but it's still another year or so before it sees any sustainable changes.

Typically, the neighborhoods get better north of 56th St anywhere across town. 52nd St isn't too bad though. The worst places in Lawrence are going to be around 38th St and 42nd St. I would look that the crime map for that specific area. I use Trulia for this. I would also ensure that the rent will be $750/mo+ and even better if it is $800/mo. That will put you on the higher end for the area.

Random Investor:
The list of prospective neighborhoods hasn't changed. I live in Broad Ripple and ride my bicycle everywhere. Another one to check out is Tarkington Park. It's near 38th street (pretty rough) but I'm seeing good changes.

N Post Road has notoriously bad crime. Rental rates will be around \$500-800 max.

30th street to 42nd street and N Franklin Rd to N German Church Rd.? one of the most dangerous areas of the city. Type in “police shootout post road Indianapolis” and look at how many different incidents come up. this area has a bad reputation due to a couple of apartments on the corners of Post and 38th and Post and 42nd. The further east that you move from Post, the lower the crime. These are lower income neighborhoods but the typical rents will be $750-$800.

In my opinon the 38th Street and Meridian, N Post Rd, 16th Street and Tibbs, and Washington Park neighborhood are the most dangerous.

Bate Hendricks neighborhood is often featured on the HGTV show Good Bones, as are the neighboring areas of Fountain Square and Old Southside.
Bates Hendricks is the neighborhood of the year in Indy as far as gentrification is concerned. Bates-Hendricks is easily between a C-D area right now. It is coming back and with the explosion of growth in Fountain Square there are some good deals.

on Sutherland Ave. there are houses in the range of 300-500k. Two streets over, but still in the same neighborhood, houses are 40-80k.
That being said, some oareas that you will typically do well in are Broad Ripple, Carmel, Fishers, Westfield, Zionsville.

Right now our team is excited about the development in these neighborhoods:
Twin Aire
Christian Park
South Fountain Square
East Fountain Square
Arsenal Heights
Mapleton Fall Creek
King Park
Friends and Neighbors
Garfield Park
Bates-Hendricks (it's still possible to find a deal here but it's quickly becoming saturated)

### High Return Real Estate - Indiana

We chose Indy because of the opportunity.... not so much for the appreciation, but because Indy has SO MANY things going for it for investors...

- low prices

- very good price-to-rent-ratios in the B class neighborhoods, and fantastic price-to-rent-ratios in the C class neighborhoods,

- low property taxes

- very landlord friendly laws

- major city with good transportation, good infrastructure, and solid employment

Notice that appreciation is not on the above list. That said, Indy is going through somewhat of a renaissance... there are pockets that are going crazy, but we are so focused on squeezing the most ROI/cash flow that we don't really worry about appreciation. Oh sure, we will buy next to gentrifying areas, and get some bleed-over. But, appreciation is ONLY meaningful when you sell or refi.

If you're doing Buy/Hold, there's not a better city in the country to do it... but you can't put appreciation into your numbers...it's conjecture/speculation, and you're doing yourself a disservice if you're using those numbers in your calcs for a buy/hold purchase.
