Real Estate Tax Benefits and Strategies
----------------------------------------

Great Resource at: https://www.madfientist.com/tax-benefits-of-real-estate-investing

1.  Depreciation Tax Deduction
    The IRS uses depreciation to acknowledge that an asset wears down over time. Somehow they discovered that 
    residential real estate wears down in exactly 27.5 years. Unlike other business expenses, depreciation is 
    a paper loss. This means you don’t spend any money, yet you still get the expense. This expense can offset 
    taxable income and save money on your tax bill.
    Depreciation is only deductible against other passive income. If your rental income is 3k, depreciation is 
    5k, you have a 2k loss. Can you deduct that 2k somewhere else? ONLY IF:

        1. $25,000 exemption – You can deduct up to$25,000 of passive rental loss against nonpassive income if 
           your income (MAGI to be exact) is below \$100,000 and you actively participate with your rental. 
           https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/can-you-deduct-your-rental-losses.html

        2. Real estate professional – You can deduct ALL of the passive rental loss against nonpassive income 
           if you or a spouse qualify as a real estate professional. Hhere are the standards: 
           https://www.biggerpockets.com/renewsblog/2014/09/25/your-complete-guide-to-the-real-estate-professional-tax-loophole

        3. Year of sale – You can deduct ALL of the passive rental loss (even from past years) 
           against nonpassive income the year you sell the rental property.

        
        Example of how tax deductions work:

        > Scenario #1 (without depreciation expense):
        > $5,000 taxable rental income x 25% federal income tax rate =$1,250 taxes owed
        > Scenario #2 (with depreciation expense):
        > $5,000 rental income –$3,000 depreciation expense = $2,000 taxable rental income$2,000 x 25% 
          federal income tax rate = $500 taxes owed


    Tax Savings =$1,250 –$500 =\$750

2.  Avoid FICA (Payroll) Tax on Rental Income
    Just like dividends and interest income, rental income is not subject to social security and medicare taxes 
    (aka FICA).
    If you earn money at a normal salaried job, you pay 7.65% (as of 2018) of your salary in FICA taxes. 
    If you’re self-employed, you pay 15.3% towards FICA tax. For Rental income you pay 0!!

3.  No Tax On Appreciation (aka Buy & Hold Like Buffett)
    And real estate appreciation doesn’t get taxed by the IRS. So, if you buy and hold for many years it’s 
    possible to let your net worth grow with no tax exposure.

4.  Capital Gains Tax at Lower Rates
    As of 2018, long-term capital gains tax rates are between 0% to 20%, depending upon your tax bracket. 
    Low capital gains rates are an advantage if you build your long-term investment strategy around 
    strategically selling real estate for growth or living expenses. At the point when you are in a 
    low Capital gains Tax bracket (retired or stop working), sell your proprties for 0% (or low) Capital gains Tax.

5.  Live In Your Flip = No Taxes
    What if you want to avoid capital gains tax altogether? Then just buy and immediately move into the 
    house as your principle residence. As long as you live in the home 2 out of the next 5 years, in the U.S. you can make a tax-free profit of up to $250,000 as an individual or$500,000 as a couple. Keep in mind that this doesn’t have to be a permanent strategy. You could do 2 or 3 flips, reinvest the earnings, and move on to other investment strategies.

6.  Exchange Properties For Tax-Free Growth (1031 Exchange)
    Another way to avoid capital gains tax (and also depreciation recapture tax) is a section 1031 tax-free 
    exchange.
    A 1031 exchange allows you to trade one property for another without paying taxes. You must follow 
    specific rules, and you must be classified as an investor (i.e. not a dealer who flips houses).

7.  Installment Sales For Income & Deferred Taxes
    This is where the seller becomes the lender to the buyer (aka seller financing or seller carry-back mortgage).
    Like 1031 exchanges, installment sales are only available to property investors and not to dealers
    (house flippers). Also like 1031 exchanges, installment sales allow an investor to defer capital gains tax, 
    but unfortunately the entire amount of accumulated depreciation must be recaptured at the initial time 
    of sale.

    For example, you buy a property at 50k, but it is now worth 300k. An installment sale would allow you 
    to only pay taxes on the profits received each year. A \$250,000 gain at one time would have pushed you 
    into higher tax brackets. But the installment sale allows you to slowly receive the gains and possibly 
    stay in lower, more favorable tax brackets. Installment sales can be a great way to transition out of 
    active property management and into a period of more passive income.

8.  Borrow Tax-Free Instead of Sell
    To raise cash most investors consider selling investments. As I’ve shown above, this exposes you to 
    taxes or complicated procedures to avoid tax. But with real estate you have another choice. You can 
    simply pull capital out of an investment tax-free by refinancing. In the end when I need money, 
    I am leaning towards refinancing the properties instead of selling. As long as the debt is fixed interest, 
    low rate, and have renters to cover this expense this is a good situation. Some benefits:

    - Get to keep a well-performing property that I know very well
    - Benefit from future loan amortization as my tenants pay it off again
    - Benefit from future appreciation of rents and property price
    - NO tax paid on the cash from the refinance because it’s borrowed

9.  Self-Directed IRA Real Estate Investing
    You can actually use your IRA or 401k to invest in real estate. But most larger retirement account 
    custodians (i.e. Vanguard, Schwab, etc) do not choose to offer them as a possibility. So, 
    there is an entire industry of specialized custodians who do allow investments in these non-traditional 
    assets. A google search will give you dozens of possibilities. A good company is American IRA. 
    This can be complicated and not recommended unless doing more research. The way to go though, 
    is a loan against real estate. It’s lower risk and has fewer moving parts than actually owning the 
    real estate itself. I have also purchased local property tax liens, which often pay high interest 
    rates and even sometimes get you a deed to real estate for pennies on the dollar.

10. Die With Real Estate (Seriously)
    Heirs dont pay capital gain taxes on your gains.

    For example, let’s say you bought a rental house for $100,000. Forty years later you die and the 
    house is worth$500,000. When your heirs sell the house, they would not pay capital gains tax on the 
    $400,000 gain. Instead, their basis would be$500,000, which means they could sell it for \$500,000 
    and have no capital gains tax to pay.

    Keep in mind that inherited assets are still subject to estate taxes. But as of this writing (2018) 
    \$11.18 million of assets are exempt from any estate taxes. So, your heirs would inherit a lot of 
    property before paying any taxes.

11. Business Tax Deductions?
    Can these be deducted from RE and also personal Income too? RESEARCH MORE WITH A CPA
    - Dinners with clients
    - Trips (They have to start out as business - you cannot go and then do business on a whim after)
    - Home office
    - Computer, Wifi, etc
    - Keep receipts

### 1.0.2. Tax Deductions
------------------------------
Move your expenses under your business

Cell phone purchase and bills
Laptop/computers
TVs - education of business
Trips (as long as you go with the intent for business BEFORE you start it)
Hire your kids
Car (This is not an automatic write off so be careful here)

Education training - make sure you tell your CPA that you decided to do Real Estate before you bought the
 package of training

- Dining (type 1 doing bus w someone 50%, type 2 traveling (outside normal commute 50%, type 3 company 
  event w majority not owners 100%) - can be alone, ) write down on receipt / calendar - Receipts are for 
  audit protection, not bookeeping (take a pic throw it away)
- Entertainment 50% (Hobbies, Toys, Keep good records, Golfing, snowmobiles)

### Capital Gains Tax

1. You pay 15% profit on any gains you make when you sell something. 
   Long Term is less than Short term???
   Tax bracket can push you higher???

2. If you hold it for a year you pay less - long term capital gains vs short term

3. If you live in the house for 2 years, then you get 250k free profit u dont pay tax (if single - 
   more if married)

### 1.0.4. 1031 Exchange

The purpose of a 1031 exchange is to defer paying 15 percent taxes on capital gains. It could end up more if 
you factor in income tax and depreciation costs?

General Rules:

      1. Like kind - It has to be a real property for a real property
      2. You have 45 days to find another property from the day you sell
      3. You have 180 days to CLOSE on another property from the day you sell
      4. You must purchase property of equal or greater value than the adjusted value (not the price value 
         — but the adjusted cost basis when taking into account depreciation less commissions and 
         closing costs) of the property you sold, or you will be taxed on the difference.
      5. During the interim of selling your first place and closing on your second, you cannot touch/look 
         at/be near the profits from the first place you sold. That money stays with a 1031 exchange 
         facilitator (qualified intermediary) and not, not, not with you.
      6. The old property and the new property must be sold and bought by the same entity. Meaning, 
         if you sell a property as John Smith, you have to buy the new one as John Smith — and not as 
         Smith, LLC.
      7. This point has been debated by the experts, but a good rule of thumb for the majority of you is this: 
         You must own your property for one year and one day to make this 1031 exchange. Otherwise, will be 
         penalized. Its called seasoned property
      8. If you keep even $1 of the capital gains you pay tax ON ALL OF IT. Make sure the value of the 
         property you are going to buy is 115% of the prev just to be sure it doesn't get assessed too low.

### 1.0.6. PROCESS - Filing Taxes at the end of the year
---------------------------------------------------------
- PROCESS TO DO TAXES AT THE END OF THE YEAR

- Find a good accountant

- Quickbooks???

- LLC (Single membership) is a disregarded entity and thus has no tax benefit for an individual holding 
property through it. Partnerships are different though.

- Compile your tax deductions

### Deductions against my W2

My business can have a lot of expenses. If it far exceeds my profits, I can write them off as losses and 
claim those losses against my W2 income. - I can do this for 3 years before the IRS says no bueno, 
that is just a hobby, not a business. Don't make it too obvious - write off 20k with a \$100 profit. 
5-10k in losses is ok?

### Tax Forms

### Tips

Figuring out the best tax strategy
Whats ur plan for 10 years down the road? 5 years?

Board of Advisors

Strategic Plan -------
15 rentals in 5 years, cashflowing 5k a month
$300 a month each of 80k rental - requires 20-25k down
plus LLCs, and other fees, closing fees, etc so each$300 cashflow prop will take 30k down

30k x 15 = 450k Is that doable? in 5 years?

100k or less agi 150k diff rules
U can take 25k loss

@Daniel Kong that’s not how it works. Your LLC rentals go to your schedule E and all those expenses and 
income are netted and included in a separate line item from your W2 on your 1040

## How to Take a Section 179 Deduction

1. First, you purchase qualified property and start using it during the year.

2. Then, you sit down with your tax professional at tax time. You will need records on the date of 
   purchase, date, you started using the property, and all costs associated with the purchase 
   (like freight and setup).

3. You add up all the items of property that are qualified. You will need to read the IRS information 
   carefully to make sure your property is qualified.

4. Then you can take the 179 deduction by electing it (described below). The amount of the 
   deduction is the total cost of all of the property, up to $500,000 for each individual item of property. 
   The total Section 179 deductions for all property can't exceed the $2 million maximum.

Use IRS Form 4562 to Elect a Section 179 Deduction
The form used to report information for a Section 179 deduction is IRS Form 4562. This form collects 
information on business property acquired and put into service (see above). For more details on completing 
Form 4562, see the IRS instructions for this form.

## Depreciation and Depreciation Recapture
-------------------------------------------

To recap the basics, upon the acquisition of a property the cost of the building and land are capitalized. 
If the building is a rental property or used in a trade or business, the cost attributable to the building 
is depreciated over 27.5 years (residential) or 39 years (non-residential) using the straight-line method 
for tax purposes. Land is non-depreciable therefore, no depreciation is permitted. In summary, the cost of 
the building is written off ratably over the life of the asset via annual depreciation deductions.

Depreciation deductions offer the property owner the tax benefit of a deduction at their personal ordinary 
income tax rates. Additionally, depreciation deductions reduce the cost basis of the property which 
ultimately determines the gain or loss upon the sale or disposition of the property. If sold as a 
long-term gain, under current tax laws, long-term capital gains tax rates range between 0% – 20% 
depending on the taxpayer’s level of income.

However, not all gains benefit from the long-term capital gain tax rates. Depreciation recapture is the 
portion of the gain attributable to the depreciation deductions previously allowed during the period the 
taxpayer owned the property. The depreciation recapture rate on this portion of the gain is 25%. The 
reasoning behind the depreciation recapture rules is since the taxpayer received the benefit of a 
depreciation deduction that offset ordinary income tax rates (a potential Federal tax savings of up to 39.6%), 
the government is not going to grant the most favorable capital gains rates on the portion of the gain 
relating to these prior depreciation deductions. The following examples illustrate the concept of 
depreciation recapture.

Assume a property owner acquired a building for $2 million (excluding land). Assume after 10 years the 
owner has taken $500,000 of depreciation deductions. The owner’s basis in the building is now $1.5 million. 
If the owner sells the building for $5 million, they will recognize a gain of $3.5 million 
($5 million less $1.5 million). It is often presumed the $3.5 million would be taxed at a capital gain 
rate of 20%. However, in this example, $500,000 of the gain would be taxed at the recapture rate of 25%. 
The remaining $3 million gain would be taxed at the 20% capital gain rate. The outcome in this example is 
an additional $25,000 tax cost (5% on $500,000). Larger transactions would obviously have larger implications.

Depreciation recapture is limited to the lesser of the gain or, the depreciation previously taken. 
Using the example above, assume the owner sells the building for $1.6 million resulting in a gain of 
only $100,000. Since the $100,000 gain is less than the $500,000 of depreciation deductions the recapture 
rate of 25% would apply to the entire \$100,000 gain.

In the event a property is sold at a loss the depreciation recapture rules do not apply. Assume in the 
above example the property was sold for $1.1 million. The property owner would simply report a loss of 
$400,000. No depreciation recapture calculations would be required.

The 25% depreciation recapture tax rate only applies to the portion of the gain attributable to real 
property. If a sales contract includes the sale of other assets, such as furniture and equipment, 
the gain relating to depreciation recapture on those assets would be taxed at the property owner’s 
ordinary income tax rates.

### Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT)

You pay 3.8% if your income is over 200k - Try to avoid this by keeping income below 200k!!!



### My Personal Tax Situation
---------------------------------------

#### W2 income - normal income

#### Rental property purchased under my own name in Indiana -

include rent and security deposit as passive income (this is added to my AGI)
not included in state tax return (Fed and state agi will be different??)

can deduct expenses from property -
-depreciation (assignment fee is included as part of purchase price - what about title fees etc - 
 total wired to title company?)
-insurance
-utilities
-education???
If net negative, then can claim up to 25k against W2 (As long as my MAGI is under 100k)

#### Rental property owned in Hawaii (AirBnB)

include rent as passive income
included in state tax return
pay Hawaii GET (TAT if short term rental)

can deduct expenses from property income
-rent
-utilities
-other expenses like purchases
If net negative, then can claim up to 25k against W2 (As long as my MAGI is under 100k)

#### Private lending -

If I lend to another investor (my LLC), and get interest - do I claim that? what if I dont get interest?

#### Software Consulting

#### Real estate education/software

valid documentation - line on my credit card statement - date of payment and to who

Can this can be claimed as Start Up costs - 5k max and then depreciation of rest over 15 years?
(Since i took the courses before acquiring my rental)
(or maybe not since i dont have an active business…)

#### Gifts from mom - do i pay taxes on that?

What about my brother/friend going 50/50 with me on a house? What if we dont use an LLC 
- easier to just claim it as a gift?
Best strategy for that
Can other people contribute to my LLC?
