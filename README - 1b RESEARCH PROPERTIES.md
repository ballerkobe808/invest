- Homefixers Zillow Comps, (property tax, general feel)
- Trulia (Crime maps, Demographics, Etc)
- Rentometer
- Areavibes
- Neighborhoodscout
- Redfin - search the zipcode then filter for sold

### 1.2.2.1. PROCESS - Assess the Neighborhoods Desirability

Targeting neighborhoods helps you get to know how to spot a deal/interact with it

Rehabbing criteria:

1. Proximity to your house/travel time.
2. Selling prices of the homes in the neighborhood (higher better)
3. Sales activity of the homes in the neighborhood (higher better). If low days on market, high demand, people are moving in. High days on market, low demand, people moving out.
4. Ages of the homes in the neighborhood (too new is bad, too old is bad)
5. Appeal and charm of the neighborhood (homeowner pride)
6. Safety of the neighborhood

Rental criteria:

1. Population makeup - ethnicity, age, demographics, crime, growing, etc
2. Job market diversified? (If a big company pulls out of the area, will jobs be lost?)
3. New companies moving in or out soon? Any big events trending soon?
4. Housing market - Are prices going up? Look for a low foreclosure %
5. Look for a low cost of living.
6. What is the vacancy rate of the city?
7. Any special conditions? Flood zone, or hurricane prone (Florida, etc)

### PROCESS - Assess Property Value (ARV)

1. Get the Comps. Ask agent to run a CMA (Comparative Market Analysys) report. Based on:

   1. Within the past 6 months
   2. Close proximity
   3. Similar size (sq feet)
   4. Similar Layout (2 bed 1 bath)
   5. Similar year built

2. Drive to the Comps and use your eyes. See if they're better or worse than your property using:

   1. Condition. Roof, garage doors, windows, driveway, walkways, porches
   2. Curb Appeal. The architecute, trees, lawn, landscaping, lot size, and grade
   3. View. Water, city skyline, mountains, any eyesores
   4. Street. Cul-de-sac, major street, major intersecion, pride of ownership evident
   5. Proximity to Infrastructure. Commercial businesses, factories, undesirable establishments, highways, power lines, parking lots, bus stops etc.

3. Read the Market. Today, 6 month forecast? Some things to consider are:

   1. Mortgate rate trends. Are rates going up or down in next 6 months? Higher rates drop home prices
   2. Seasonal buying cylcle. Home sales usually take a dip during winter months, but pick up in the summer.
   3. Time on market. Ask realtor for time on market - average time sitting - slow or fast
   4. Developments. Anything that will cause people to want to move in or leave? Major employers, schools, stores, churches, parks, pools, entertainment value

4. Check with Experts. Check with local experts. Some to consider are:

   1. Neighborhood Realtors. Agents who specialize in that neighborhood.
   2. Appraisers. Get an actual appraisal ($300-500). See if you can just get a verbal appraisal for a discount. Let them know you are looking for the ARV, not current condition.
   3. Neighborhod Residents. Talk to people who live there.

### Interview Turnkey/Owner

Find out what the turnkey provider or owner is like. Big question is if you can trust them. Lots of times just trying to gauge that - competency and trust.

Questions

- How do you vet your actual providers? (if they have some)
- Ask them "What separates you from other companies?"
- Can you send me the rent rolls, of current/previous tenants
- What kind of shape is the property in? Has any work been done recently? Do you have any documentation of that?

- Do you own the property? If not, who is the company/person who is selling it? Always better selling their own
- Was the property rehabbed? Who did the rehab? Always better to know the rehab workmanship personally
- Does it currently need any repairs? If so, what do you think the estimated costs will be?
- Can you tell me a little more about the neighborhood (want them to describe it in their own terms)

### Questions for a Turnkey Company

1.  Does your company own the turnkey properties you are selling or are you a marketer?
    You will find that many “turnkey sellers” are actually just marketers selling actual turnkey providers properties. These marketers typically mark up the price of the property a little but so they can get a piece of the pie. There is no sense in working with a marketer when you can go direct to a turnkey provider and cut costs and time. Cut out the middleman!!

2.  How long have you been in business as a turnkey seller?
    The longer they have been in business the better. There are many new providers popping out left and right and although this isn’t necessarily a bad thing, having more experience selling turnkeys will lead to a more efficient and better experience when buying.

3.  Do you own any rentals in the same neighborhoods you’re selling in? Do you stand by your product?
    It would be a good sign if the turnkey provider invests in their own properties and has their own portfolio of rental investments in the same locale they are selling. If not, this could be a red flag.

4.  How many markets/cities do you sell in?
    Multiple cities and markets could mean the turnkey seller does not own the properties themselves and are a marketer. What I’ve found is the best turnkey sellers only offer properties where they live.

5.  How many out of state investors do you work with?
    Do you have any investor referrals I can speak to first hand that have acquired 1 or more of your turnkeys?
    You are looking for a team that has experience catering to out of state investors. If they cannot provide referrals of previous customers to talk to than that is a red flag.

6.  What types of neighborhoods do you purchase/sell properties in? A, B, C, D classes?
    The best turnkey properties typically fall in either the B or C class properties. A’s are usually too expensive and there is no cash flow. D’s are high crime areas which you don’t want.

7.  What is the rehab process like on each property? What items are replaced?
    Ideally the properties provided from the turnkey provider should include a new rehab with all new or newer mechanical’s including roof, HVAC, water heater, updated electrical, and updated plumbing.

8.  Can I fly out and take a tour of your operation and view available properties?
    It is highly recommended that you do fly out there and visit the company you are wanting to work with. You need to see firsthand how they operate, who they are, and more importantly the quality of the properties they have and locale. Nothing says more than seeing it for yourself. If they don’t provide this, run! To read about my experience flying out and doing just this, read here.

9.  Do you provide a home warranty for the first year?
    Most turnkey providers will give you a first year’s home warranty which will replace any of the newly replaced items free of charge if they go out on you. Nice to have!

10. Do you allow lender financing for purchasing your turnkeys?
    A legit and reputable turnkey provider will allow you to provide your own conventional financing. This is a big deal because using conventional financing means an independent appraisal is required. This covers your butt to make sure you are not over paying for the turnkey. You should be expecting to pay no more than market value for whatever turnkey property you are interested in. If a turnkey seller won’t allow an appraisal, run! Even if they tell you that they only accept cash offers because the properties sell so quickly. They will always say this when they don’t allow financing. Just find another company!
    If a turnkey seller won’t allow an appraisal, run!

11) Do you offer any rental or maintenance guarantees?
    Some turnkey providers will offer a guarantee of some sort. Take this as a warning as this is really more of a sales gimmick. If they do say yes, ask them if it applies when it really matters like years 2 – 4.

12) Will the turnkey property be fully occupied with a tenant before closing?
    A true turnkey company will provide property management, fill the vacancy and have an already cash flowing property for you at the time of closing.

13) Do the properties come with appliances? (Fridge, Stove)
    Some turnkey providers do not supply this and you are caught off guard toward the end of the process and will have to cough up more money for these two items. This does however vary by locale so be sure to do research to find out of this is common to not include these appliances.

14) Can you provide a step by step process of what the turnkey purchasing is like with your company?
    They should be able to provide to you a rundown of all the steps involved when purchasing a turnkey from the first step to the last step. It is very good to hear this as you’re not caught with any surprises during the process.

15) Do you provide property management in-house or outsource to a 3rd party?
    Regardless the answer to this one, there is a whole set of property management questions that need to be asked to whoever the property manager will be. It is preferred that they have the property management team in-house in my opinion, as they will provide you better service since they know they will be dealing with you in the future and are vested in this property. See property management questions below. To see the top 10 qualities for a property management company, click here.

The questions above are specifically for the turnkey provider and how they operate. The questions below are meant toward the property management aspect of the turnkey business. Some turnkey companies will provide their own property management through a different company they own or they will outsource the property management to a 3rd party in which they have a partnership with. Either way works however be sure to ask the property management team the questions below.

### Home Inspection

Hello, I am investor looking to purchase a property in the 46241 zipcode. I'd like to schedule a full home inspection to find any major issues that might come up while getting the house ready to rent. I'm looking to put some money into the property to fix it up, but would just like a general idea of what would be involved before purchase. How much would this cost, and how soon could I set up an appointment? Thank you!
