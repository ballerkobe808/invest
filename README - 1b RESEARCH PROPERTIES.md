# 1. RESEARCHING PROPERTIES

## 1.2. Researching a Property

### 1.2.1. PROCESS - Guide to QUICKLY gather data

- Homefixers Zillow Comps, (property tax, general feel)
- Trulia (Crime maps, Demographics, Etc)
- Rentometer
- Areavibes
- Neighborhoodscout
- Find a local Realtor/Property Manager and speak to them (Look them up on Yelp)
- Nite Owl prop search (search by owner)

- OTHER SOURCES --------------------
- Walk the neighborhood with Google Street map view
- Realtor.com (Look at general Data)
- Redfin.com
- MLS
- Craigslist (post similar for rent, if 50 emails, post higher price, till you find the actual rent price)
- Walkscore
- Hotpads
- County Tax site
- Email/Call for insurance prices using property addreess and largest deductable. Or Google "investor homeowners insurance Atlanta", read the reviews and call the highest reviewed one.
- Look up a record of past permits online (County's site)

### 1.2.2.1. PROCESS - Assess the Neighborhoods Desirability

Targeting neighborhoods helps you get to know how to spot a deal/interact with it

Rehabbing criteria:

1. Proximity to your house/travel time.
2. Selling prices of the homes in the neighborhood (higher better)
3. Sales activity of the homes in the neighborhood (higher better). If low days on market, high demand, people are moving in. High days on market, low demand, people moving out.
4. Ages of the homes in the neighborhood (too new is bad, too old is bad)
5. Appeal and charm of the neighborhood (homeowner pride)
6. Safety of the neighborhood

Rental criteria:

1. Population makeup - ethnicity, age, demographics, crime, growing, etc
2. Job market diversified? (If a big company pulls out of the area, will jobs be lost?)
3. New companies moving in or out soon? Any big events trending soon?
4. Housing market - Are prices going up? Look for a low foreclosure %
5. Look for a low cost of living.
6. What is the vacancy rate of the city?
7. Any special conditions? Flood zone, or hurricane prone (Florida, etc)

### PROCESS - Assess Property Value (ARV)

1. Get the Comps. Ask agent to run a CMA (Comparative Market Analysys) report. Based on:

   1. Within the past 6 months
   2. Close proximity
   3. Similar size (sq feet)
   4. Similar Layout (2 bed 1 bath)
   5. Similar year built

2. Drive to the Comps and use your eyes. See if they're better or worse than your property using:

   1. Condition. Roof, garage doors, windows, driveway, walkways, porches
   2. Curb Appeal. The architecute, trees, lawn, landscaping, lot size, and grade
   3. View. Water, city skyline, mountains, any eyesores
   4. Street. Cul-de-sac, major street, major intersecion, pride of ownership evident
   5. Proximity to Infrastructure. Commercial businesses, factories, undesirable establishments, highways, power lines, parking lots, bus stops etc.

3. Read the Market. Today, 6 month forecast? Some things to consider are:

   1. Mortgate rate trends. Are rates going up or down in next 6 months? Higher rates drop home prices
   2. Seasonal buying cylcle. Home sales usually take a dip during winter months, but pick up in the summer.
   3. Time on market. Ask realtor for time on market - average time sitting - slow or fast
   4. Developments. Anything that will cause people to want to move in or leave? Major employers, schools, stores, churches, parks, pools, entertainment value

4. Check with Experts. Check with local experts. Some to consider are:

   1. Neighborhood Realtors. Agents who specialize in that neighborhood.
   2. Appraisers. Get an actual appraisal ($300-500). See if you can just get a verbal appraisal for a discount. Let them know you are looking for the ARV, not current condition.
   3. Neighborhod Residents. Talk to people who live there.

### Interview Turnkey/Owner

Find out what the turnkey provider or owner is like. Big question is if you can trust them. Lots of times just trying to gauge that - competency and trust.

- WHY ARE YOU SELLING? Figure this out to see if you can come up with a creative way for a win-win

Questions

- [Reputation on Bigger Pockets]
- Start with open-ended questions and just try to let them talk - get a gauge on them
- Can you tell me more about your company?
- What is your role in the process? Buy? Rehab? Sell? Property Management? Why are you selling?
- How do you vet your actual providers? (if they have some)
- Ask them "What separates you from other companies?"
- Can you send me the rent rolls, of current/previous tenants
- What kind of shape is the property in? Has any work been done recently? Do you have any documentation of that?

- Do you own the property? If not, who is the company/person who is selling it? Always better selling their own
- Was the property rehabbed? Who did the rehab? Always better to know the rehab workmanship personally
- Does it currently need any repairs? If so, what do you think the estimated costs will be?
- Can you tell me a little more about the neighborhood (want them to describe it in their own terms)
- Big 6 Cap Exp Questions - Find facts and also get a feel on how they answer. Ask Hey ball park numbers, what would it cost to redo the roof, etc - just to get a feel. 1 Roof, 2 HVAC, 3 Foundation, 4 Plumbing, 5 Electrical, 6 Termites

### Property Management & Questions to ask

Find out more about the property management team and make sure you are comfortable working with them. Nothing is more important to the success of your property or peace of mind, than the property management company and their communication, responsiveness, and committment to excellence. Good chance this guy doesn't care about your investment - make sure you are comfortable here - find the right team!

Questions:

- Can you tell me more about your property management company? (How much experience do they have?) How do you handle problems - how big are you? Processes in place..?
- What are the fees? Setup fee - say $300 to open account - Monthly 8%-12%? Is this on rent Collected, or rent due, rent scheduled, rent value, etc. It should be on rent collected to assure not paying when there is no rent. Vacancy Fee? Listing/new tenant fee? Lease renewal fee? Maintenance fees? Eviction fee?
- What is their average vacancy rate? (Charge when there is a vacancy?) So important to keep rentals filled...
- Are there Tenants currently? (Rent Rolls available?) (Lease Agreements?) How sure is the rental price? If you are unsure here, then call around for property managers in the area and get their opinion - you can possibly go with one of them if you like them as well (Yelp is a good resource).
- Ask a question about how they would handle a specific problem to see if they will try to save you money or just hire a plumber and be done with it. How much do they care?

Questions to Ask Property Management Companies

1. What are your fees? Do you charge a flat fee or a percent of rent?
   Seven to twelve percent of rent is typical, but you may be able to negotiate a lower percentage depending on the circumstances. For example, if they will be managing multiple properties for you, they may cut you a deal.
2. Do you have references?
   Get references of both current and former clients, and call them all. Search the internet for reviews. Ask around.
3. How many properties are you managing? Do you manage both short-term and long-term rentals?
   These days, many property managers are involved with managing short-term rentals through sites like Airbnb and VRBO. Short-term rentals are a different business and can take up a lot of a property manager’s time. Make sure they have the time to focus on your long-term rentals.
4. How long have you been in business?
   You want to make sure they’ve been in business long enough to have a track record and evidence they plan to stick around.
5. How many people work for your company, and what are their roles?
   You want to know who is taking care of business behind the scenes. If your contact leaves or goes on holiday, you want to know who to contact. You also want to get a sense of the infrastructure. Are they trying to do everything themselves, or do they have a support staff?
6. Do you have electronic and automated systems set up?
   These days, property managers should have client portals and electronic payment systems set up for convenience and record keeping. For example, is there an online portal where you can go to generate reports and see property accounts in real time (instead of waiting weeks for a monthly report)?
   7.How often do you check in on tenants and properties? Do you do an annual walk-through?
   A good property manager will check in with the property and tenants even if they haven’t heard from them. Some tenants won’t report needed repairs and damage leaving you and the property manager in the dark. You don’t want to find an unpleasant surprise when the tenant moves out.
   8.Who keeps the damage deposits?
   Don’t let the property manager keep them. While most people are honest and trustworthy, I did have a property manager steal the tenant damage deposits, which ended up costing us a lot of money to replace the deposits!
7. What financial institution do you use?
   Try to get the management company to work with a bank account at your financial institution instead of letting them put rent receipts in to their own account. This usually only works with larger properties and portfolios though.
8. What do you charge for evictions?
   Hopefully this never comes up, but it is better to know upfront than to be surprised if an eviction is necessary.
9. Will you advertise and show a property while it is occupied, or do you insist on properties being vacant before you will start advertising them for rent?
   If the latter is true, this will lead to 1–2 months of lost rent every time a tenant switch happens.
10. How long does it take you to turn a property around in between tenants? Can you do it in 24 hours or does the owner have to lose weeks to a month of rent every time a tenant change occurs?

Questions to Ask About Tenants

13. Do you conduct credit and criminal background checks on prospective tenants?
    This is easy to do these days and a must.
14. What is your philosophy on tenant selection, getting properties rented? Do you try to get top dollar and raise rents aggressively or do you prefer more of a value play?
    The rent amount is ultimately the owner’s decision, but if your property is outside of your local area, you will most likely rely on your property manager to know the market. It is beneficial if you and your property manager have similar philosophies on tenant selection and where to set the rental amount.
15. Do you take photos of the property before and after move in and out?
    They should, and this is easy to do. Documentation of the property condition is critical should any disputes arise.
16. Do you offer a tenant placement guarantee?
    If the tenant is evicted or moves out before the lease term is up, will the property manager find a new tenant for free?
    Questions to Ask About Repairs
17. How do you handle tenant calls for repairs? Do you try to solve the problem before sending out a repair person?
    I’ve found that often the problem can be handled by asking a few questions and the tenant doing a few easy tasks. This can end up saving a lot on unnecessary repair expenses.
18. Do you establish a threshold $ amount on repairs above which you always call owner? If so, what is that dollar amount?
19. Who do you use for repairs? Electrical, plumbing, appliances?
    Do they have a handy man that they try to use for most repairs or do they use outside vendors? If they have a skilled handy man you may get quality work for less.
20. What is your philosophy on repairs and replacement?
    Do they try to find the least-expensive solution since this is a rental, or do they prefer a value solution so the repair or replacement will last? Different owners and property managers have different approaches. You want to find a property manager that shares your same philosophy.


### Questions for a Turnkey Company

1)  Does your company own the turnkey properties you are selling or are you a marketer?
You will find that many “turnkey sellers” are actually just marketers selling actual turnkey providers properties. These marketers typically mark up the price of the property a little but so they can get a piece of the pie.  There is no sense in working with a marketer when you can go direct to a turnkey provider and cut costs and time.  Cut out the middleman!!

2) How long have you been in business as a turnkey seller?
The longer they have been in business the better. There are many new providers popping out left and right and although this isn’t necessarily a bad thing, having more experience selling turnkeys will lead to a more efficient and better experience when buying.

 3) Do you own any rentals in the same neighborhoods you’re selling in? Do you stand by your product?
It would be a good sign if the turnkey provider invests in their own properties and has their own portfolio of rental investments in the same locale they are selling. If not, this could be a red flag.

 4) How many markets/cities do you sell in?
Multiple cities and markets could mean the turnkey seller does not own the properties themselves and are a marketer. What I’ve found is the best turnkey sellers only offer properties where they live.

5) How many out of state investors do you work with? Do you have any investor referrals I can speak to first hand that have acquired 1 or more of your turnkeys?
You are looking for a team that has experience catering to out of state investors. If they cannot provide referrals of previous customers to talk to than that is a red flag.

 6) What types of neighborhoods do you purchase/sell properties in? A, B, C, D classes?
The best turnkey properties typically fall in either the B or C class properties. A’s are usually too expensive and there is no cash flow.  D’s are high crime areas which you don’t want.

 7) What is the rehab process like on each property? What items are replaced?
Ideally the properties provided from the turnkey provider should include a new rehab with all new or newer mechanical’s including roof, HVAC, water heater, updated electrical, and updated plumbing.

8) Can I fly out and take a tour of your operation and view available properties?
It is highly recommended that you do fly out there and visit the company you are wanting to work with. You need to see firsthand how they operate, who they are, and more importantly the quality of the properties they have and locale.  Nothing says more than seeing it for yourself.  If they don’t provide this, run!  To read about my experience flying out and doing just this, read here.

9) Do you provide a home warranty for the first year?
Most turnkey providers will give you a first year’s home warranty which will replace any of the newly replaced items free of charge if they go out on you. Nice to have!

 10) Do you allow lender financing for purchasing your turnkeys?
A legit and reputable turnkey provider will allow you to provide your own conventional financing. This is a big deal because using conventional financing means an independent appraisal is required.  This covers your butt to make sure you are not over paying for the turnkey.  You should be expecting to pay no more than market value for whatever turnkey property you are interested in.  If a turnkey seller won’t allow an appraisal, run!  Even if they tell you that they only accept cash offers because the properties sell so quickly.  They will always say this when they don’t allow financing.  Just find another company!
If a turnkey seller won’t allow an appraisal, run!

 11) Do you offer any rental or maintenance guarantees?
Some turnkey providers will offer a guarantee of some sort. Take this as a warning as this is really more of a sales gimmick.   If they do say yes, ask them if it applies when it really matters like years 2 – 4.

 12) Will the turnkey property be fully occupied with a tenant before closing?
A true turnkey company will provide property management, fill the vacancy and have an already cash flowing property for you at the time of closing.

 13) Do the properties come with appliances? (Fridge, Stove)
Some turnkey providers do not supply this and you are caught off guard toward the end of the process and will have to cough up more money for these two items.  This does however vary by locale so be sure to do research to find out of this is common to not include these appliances.

 14) Can you provide a step by step process of what the turnkey purchasing is like with your company?
They should be able to provide to you a rundown of all the steps involved when purchasing a turnkey from the first step to the last step. It is very good to hear this as you’re not caught with any surprises during the process.

 15) Do you provide property management in-house or outsource to a 3rd party?
Regardless the answer to this one, there is a whole set of property management questions that need to be asked to whoever the property manager will be. It is preferred that they have the property management team in-house in my opinion, as they will provide you better service since they know they will be dealing with you in the future and are vested in this property.  See property management questions below.  To see the top 10 qualities for a property management company, click here.
 

The questions above are specifically for the turnkey provider and how they operate.  The questions below are meant toward the property management aspect of the turnkey business.  Some turnkey companies will provide their own property management through a different company they own or they will outsource the property management to a 3rd party in which they have a partnership with.  Either way works however be sure to ask the property management team the questions below.

16) Is your property management team licensed?
Make sure this one is a “yes”. You don’t want an unlicensed management company as it can come back and haunt you if there are ever any legal matters.

 17) How many properties/doors do you manage? And how many employees do you have?
This will give you a glimpse into how big this company is and based on the employee/doors ratio what kind of service you can expect to get. You don’t want 1 employee handling 100 doors.  The level of service would be degraded.

 18) What is your communication response time for owners and tenants and via what means?
Preferably the PM will be able to be contacted via email, text, phone and an online portal. Response time should be no more than a few hours at the most.

19) What are your management fees?
10% of the monthly rent is average. If its more, find out why?  If its less, find out why?

 20) What is your fee for filling new tenants or re-leasing an existing tenant?
Typically its 75% to 100% of monthly rent for a brand new tenant. For a simple lease extension it should cost very little to do this as it virtually requires no effort from the PM.  Watch out for high costs on this.

 21) What percentage of expiring leases renew?
It’s better for everyone for this number to be high especially if it’s a quality tenant. Reducing tenant turnover will greatly reduce headache and keep that cash flow coming!

 22) How long is your average # of month’s occupancy per property?
Average is about 1 year. I like 18 month leases.  Locale is very dependent on the recommended answer.  If you are in a hotter area with rents increasing then you don’t want to have the tenant sign for more than 1 year as you won’t be able to raise rent prices during the lease.

 23) How do you determine market rent value?
They should be able to provide proof that the projected rent values coincide with the market. Ask for MLS rent comps.  You can even do your own research on Zillow, craigslist and rentometer to confirm the rent prices match to similar homes in the same vicinity.  If the numbers don’t match, take this as a red flag.

 24) What is the screening process like for qualifying tenants?
It’s almost impossible to find a perfect tenant but there are many steps that can be taken to securing a good tenant(s). You should expect a credit check, background check, eviction report, pay verification and previous history of rent payments from the screening process.

 25) Who is your average tenant?
College kids, blue-collar workers, families, couples and young professionals. That is what you should be hearing as those typically make the best tenants.  Also check if they do section 8 or low-income tenants.  Don’t get caught off guard if they do but be aware and do more research.  You may not want to dive into that realm as it typically means more headaches in the future but I do not have any experience in this yet so take what I say with a grain of salt.

 26) What is your eviction experience?
You want to make sure they know how to handle an eviction as quickly and efficient as possible and that only comes with experience. It’s a double edge sword though because if they have a high amount of evictions then they are most likely not screening the tenants properly.

 27) How long does it typically take to fill a vacancy?
This varies by locale however it’s good for you to have an expected time frame so you’re not caught off guard when it takes 5 weeks for your vacancy to fill.

 28) How is the security deposit handled?
There always needs to be a security deposit and it will either be held by the property management team or given to you. Find out.  Then find out how often its refunded to the tenant.

 29) How do you handle tenant delinquency? Late payments?
You need to make sure they handle these matters professionally and legally. Don’t ever let a tenant slide from having to pay a late payment fee.  This will only lead to more trouble in the future.  Run your rental properties like a business, not a hobby!

 30) What is the cost of an average repair bill after move out? (make rent ready)
It’s a good idea to get an estimate on how much on average you can expect to pay to make your rental rent ready again after vacancy.  Don’t get caught off guard a year later when this happens.

 31) Last but not least. HOW DO I GET PAID!!!
Find out when the check/ACH disbursement typically occurs after the tenant pays rent. You want your CASH FLOW!!

### Home Inspection

Hello, I am investor looking to purchase a property in the 46241 zipcode. I'd like to schedule a full home inspection to find any major issues that might come up while getting the house ready to rent. I'm looking to put some money into the property to fix it up, but would just like a general idea of what would be involved before purchase. How much would this cost, and how soon could I set up an appointment? Thank you!
