### Foreclosure -

never do one for less than 30k
It should never take you more than 15 hours to do one of these

Mortgage (sometimes this is called a trustee in certain states)
Types of Foreclosures
non-judicial: (25 states Hawaii is one of these)
judicial: is one that is done thru the court system
strict: connecticut is the only one - its different

publication - what hawaii calls the step of moving pre-forclosure to foreclosure
(30 other states use notice of defalt, notice of complaint, etc)

3 months - in hawaii - lender files publication then the auction happens
(other states have diff amount of monthes, 1, 2, 5, 7 months etc)

Hawaii:

1. you miss a payment - you get a late fee
2. you miss 3 months and 1 day behind - now the state offers the lender the right to file the publication. Same for all states
3. Once the lender files (they dont have too) this starts a 3 month clock. When that date hits, they lose their house
4.

Focus on the Pre-foreclosures here. This is where you start to apply your wholesale skills. Trying to solve peoples problems

1. less competition
2. less money
3. less time

The sequence

- Delinquency Notice
- Notice of Default
- Reinstatement Period
- Date of publication
- Date of sale
- Deficiency Judgement - washes the house clean of the bad liens

publications must be in the paper or in the courthouse
(it can optional be online TOO, but it has to be in the prev two by law)

Power of Sale - Dont buy it and pay closing cost - just have the option to sell

### Lien Theory

Voluntary

- Mortgages
- Equity Line of Credit

Involuntary

- Tax and Assessments
- federal liens
- judgement liens
- vendor's liens
- mechanic's liens

### Title search

Shows every lien or encumbrance

- if anything shows up - you have to take it one extra step
  homeowner has to sign
  "Authorization to release information" form

1. gives you permission to contact lienholders to see if debt is still owed -
2. gives you permission to negotiate on the owners behalf

Its possible the lien expired - all liens but 2 expire in 7 years or less
(IRS never goes away, Tax lien or deed never goes away)

Careful when you pull the title search and things have expired - no indicaion on the record itself.

### Assignments

9:50am start time
highlighter, sharpie, fine point pen, calculator

1 one thing ssaid today that got your attention
2 go to page 68 - pick two on the list in each section

4. page 7 and 11 in the course description Nov 1,2,3

### Lease with an option to buy

### Foreclosure ------------

Research this a lot more - how to do it in hawaii????

### Financing to allow less than 20%

### Flipping is the fastest way to generate income...

### Lease with an option strategy to buy

3 Options that will tenant will choose at the end

1. choose not to buy
2. choose to buy and use a bank
3. choose to buy and use you as the bank

The target tenant will be someone with 2300-4400 set aside for housing, that are looking to get their life back on track.
You kinda want a home that a family will live in, so at least 3/2 in hawaii, also safe neighborhoods

4 Types of Income from Lease Option

1. Non-refundable Option Payment (PCF)
2. Monthly Rent
3. Sale price is pre-negotiated and agreed upon by all parties
4. Tax Advantages (Deferment of sale allows you to Depreciate on your taxes)

Structuring the deal (Contract)

- They do minor repairs $250 or less
- We do major repairs, $250 or more

- Monthly payment to be paid in addition to lease for a credit toward down payment ("What can you afford")
- Option payment of 2-5% of current price
