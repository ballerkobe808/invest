questions -

is there a mortgage on the house? Can i take that over???
If i were to give you the money, what would you do with it?

give them a list of choices

agreement for deed (if seller has a mortgage)
put a memorandum on the title (not the agreement itself so future buyers dont see how much you paid for the property)
seller carryback mortgage (if seller owns it outright)
terms after so many years i get the property
make sure to write the depreciation into the contract - we deserve it more

subject to (take over the sellers mortgage)
taking ownership of the property (deed/title), but leaving the mortgage in the sellers name
Beware of bank calling mortgage (due on sale clause) (highly unlikely but possible)
