### 1.0.1. Real Estate Tax Benefits and Strategies

Great Resource at: https://www.madfientist.com/tax-benefits-of-real-estate-investing

1.  Depreciation Tax Deduction
    The IRS uses depreciation to acknowledge that an asset wears down over time. Somehow they discovered that residential real estate wears down in exactly 27.5 years. Unlike other business expenses, depreciation is a paper loss. This means you don’t spend any money, yet you still get the expense. This expense can offset taxable income and save money on your tax bill.
    Depreciation is only deductible against other passive income. If your rental income is 3k, depreciation is 5k, you have a 2k loss. Can you deduct that 2k somewhere else? ONLY IF:

    1. $25,000 exemption – You can deduct up to $25,000 of passive rental loss against nonpassive income if your income (MAGI to be exact) is below $100,000 and you actively participate with your rental. https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/can-you-deduct-your-rental-losses.html

    2. Real estate professional – You can deduct ALL of the passive rental loss against nonpassive income if you or a spouse qualify as a real estate professional. Hhere are the standards: https://www.biggerpockets.com/renewsblog/2014/09/25/your-complete-guide-to-the-real-estate-professional-tax-loophole

    3. Year of sale – You can deduct ALL of the passive rental loss (even from past years) against nonpassive income the year you sell the rental property.

    Example of how tax deductions work:

    > Scenario #1 (without depreciation expense):
    > $5,000 taxable rental income x 25% federal income tax rate = $1,250 taxes owed
    > Scenario #2 (with depreciation expense):
    > $5,000 rental income – $3,000 depreciation expense = $2,000 taxable rental income
    > $2,000 x 25% federal income tax rate = $500 taxes owed
    > Tax Savings = $1,250 – $500 = $750

2.  Avoid FICA (Payroll) Tax on Rental Income
    Just like dividends and interest income, rental income is not subject to social security and medicare taxes (aka FICA).
    If you earn money at a normal salaried job, you pay 7.65% (as of 2018) of your salary in FICA taxes. If you’re self-employed, you pay 15.3% towards FICA tax. For Rental income you pay 0!!

3.  No Tax On Appreciation (aka Buy & Hold Like Buffett)
    And real estate appreciation doesn’t get taxed by the IRS. So, if you buy and hold for many years it’s possible to let your net worth grow with no tax exposure.

4.  Capital Gains Tax at Lower Rates
    As of 2018, long-term capital gains tax rates are between 0% to 20%, depending upon your tax bracket. Low capital gains rates are an advantage if you build your long-term investment strategy around strategically selling real estate for growth or living expenses. At the point when you are in a low Capital gains Tax bracket (retired or stop working), sell your proprties for 0% (or low) Capital gains Tax.

5.  Live In Your Flip = No Taxes
    What if you want to avoid capital gains tax altogether? Then just buy and immediately move into the house as your principle residence. As long as you live in the home 2 out of the next 5 years, in the U.S. you can make a tax-free profit of up to $250,000 as an individual or $500,000 as a couple. Keep in mind that this doesn’t have to be a permanent strategy. You could do 2 or 3 flips, reinvest the earnings, and move on to other investment strategies.

6.  Exchange Properties For Tax-Free Growth (1031 Exchange)
    Another way to avoid capital gains tax (and also depreciation recapture tax) is a section 1031 tax-free exchange.
    A 1031 exchange allows you to trade one property for another without paying taxes. You must follow specific rules, and you must be classified as an investor (i.e. not a dealer who flips houses).

7.  Installment Sales For Income & Deferred Taxes
    This is where the seller becomes the lender to the buyer (aka seller financing or seller carry-back mortgage).
    Like 1031 exchanges, installment sales are only available to property investors and not to dealers (house flippers). Also like 1031 exchanges, installment sales allow an investor to defer capital gains tax, but unfortunately the entire amount of accumulated depreciation must be recaptured at the initial time of sale.

    For example, you buy a property at 50k, but it is now worth 300k. An installment sale would allow you to only pay taxes on the profits received each year. A $250,000 gain at one time would have pushed you into higher tax brackets. But the installment sale allows you to slowly receive the gains and possibly stay in lower, more favorable tax brackets. Installment sales can be a great way to transition out of active property management and into a period of more passive income.

8.  Borrow Tax-Free Instead of Sell
    To raise cash most investors consider selling investments. As I’ve shown above, this exposes you to taxes or complicated procedures to avoid tax. But with real estate you have another choice. You can simply pull capital out of an investment tax-free by refinancing. In the end when I need money, I am leaning towards refinancing the properties instead of selling. As long as the debt is fixed interest, low rate, and have renters to cover this expense this is a good situation. Some benefits:

    - Get to keep a well-performing property that I know very well
    - Benefit from future loan amortization as my tenants pay it off again
    - Benefit from future appreciation of rents and property price
    - NO tax paid on the cash from the refinance because it’s borrowed

9.  Self-Directed IRA Real Estate Investing
    You can actually use your IRA or 401k to invest in real estate. But most larger retirement account custodians (i.e. Vanguard, Schwab, etc) do not choose to offer them as a possibility. So, there is an entire industry of specialized custodians who do allow investments in these non-traditional assets. A google search will give you dozens of possibilities. A good company is American IRA. This can be complicated and not recommended unless doing more research. The way to go though, is a loan against real estate. It’s lower risk and has fewer moving parts than actually owning the real estate itself. I have also purchased local property tax liens, which often pay high interest rates and even sometimes get you a deed to real estate for pennies on the dollar.

10. Die With Real Estate (Seriously)
    Heirs dont pay capital gain taxes on your gains.

    For example, let’s say you bought a rental house for $100,000. Forty years later you die and the house is worth $500,000. When your heirs sell the house, they would not pay capital gains tax on the $400,000 gain. Instead, their basis would be $500,000, which means they could sell it for $500,000 and have no capital gains tax to pay.

    Keep in mind that inherited assets are still subject to estate taxes. But as of this writing (2018) $11.18 million of assets are exempt from any estate taxes. So, your heirs would inherit a lot of property before paying any taxes.

11. Business Tax Deductions?
    Can these be deducted from RE and also personal Income too? RESEARCH MORE WITH A CPA
    - Dinners with clients

### Capital Gains Tax

You pay 15% profit on any gains you make when you sell something.

### 1.0.4. 1031 Exchange

The purpose of a 1031 exchange is to defer paying 15 percent taxes on capital gains. It could end up more if you factor in income tax and depreciation costs?

General Rules:

      1.  Like kind - It has to be a real property for a real property
      2.  You have 45 days to find another property from the day you sell
      3.  You have 180 days to CLOSE on another property from the day you sell
      4.  You must purchase property of equal or greater value than the adjusted value (not the price value — but the adjusted cost basis when taking into account depreciation less commissions and closing costs) of the property you sold, or you will be taxed on the difference.
      5.  During the interim of selling your first place and closing on your second, you cannot touch/look at/be near the profits from the first place you sold. That money stays with a 1031 exchange facilitator (qualified intermediary) and not, not, not with you.
      6.  The old property and the new property must be sold and bought by the same entity. Meaning, if you sell a property as John Smith, you have to buy the new one as John Smith — and not as Smith, LLC.
      7.  This point has been debated by the experts, but a good rule of thumb for the majority of you is this: You must own your property for one year and one day to make this 1031 exchange. Otherwise, will be penalized.

### 1.0.6. PROCESS - Filing Taxes at the end of the year

- PROCESS TO DO TAXES AT THE END OF THE YEAR

- Find a good accountant

- Quickbooks???

- LLC (Single membership) is a disregarded entity and thus has no tax benefit for an individual holding property through it. Partnerships are different though.
