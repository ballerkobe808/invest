# FINDING PROPERTIES
==============================
Always be on the lookout.
Keep learning and collecting data points - helps you to internalize value and recognize deals quickly.
Most important is finding the deal - deals are made WHEN YOU BUY!

How to find Value
-----------------------
There has to be a reason why you can get the house at under market value. Be aware of this!
Keys to a property you want:

1. The house needs upgrade/repair/Foreclosing/Bank owned and wants to unload
2. The owner is motivated to sell under market value
3. It is in an area of town where people want to live (there will be demand to rent/buy later)

Rental Portfolio
-----------------------
1. At least 900 rent in SFH, 750/side in MFH
  - I want stable long term, low maint tenants - less turnover costs, issues to deal with
  - Location is important! I want somewhere that people will want to rent, 
    and that will be easy to manage. One eviction = thousands in damage, vacancy, legal fees, etc. 
    Don't just look at spreadsheet numbers

2. Price to Rent of over 1% using ARV 
  - It HAS to cashflow positive
  - Be aware of too good to be true 2% RtV 
    - often bad neighborhoods and not worth the headache 
    - tip from experienced investors 
    - also beware maint costs 
    - same price for new HVAC in 50k and 100k house

3. All in for 75% (purchase, plus rehab)
  - Trying to preserve capital and leave as little money in the deal as possible


Single Family vs Multi Family
--------------------------------
Single Family:
 + More inventory
 + Usually easier to get families/long term tenants
 + More possibility for appreciation - Home Owners will pay a premium
 
 - Less Cashflow in general

MultiFamily:
+ Better Cashflow
+ Common cap ex - roof, electrical, etc

- Less Inventory
- Possibiliy to not have separate utilities - then owner pays or more hassle
- More tenant turnover
- Less possibility for appreciation


Leads
------------
1. Wholesale lists (Get on some good ones!)
2. Investor friends, family, coworkers
3. Realtor Agents
4. Turnkey Providers (Memphis Invest, Midsouth Homebuyers, Norada, REITrader)
5. Craigslist, Zillow, MLS, ebay, trulia, redfin
6. Foreclosures: Shadow inventory - inventory held by banks you dont know exists,
8. Other online sites: repropfinder.com, Foreclosures.com, Auction.com, HUDHomestore, fsbo.com, Fannie Mae Homepath.com
10. Probate??






PROCESS - Assess the Neighborhoods Desirability
---------------------------------------------------------
Targeting neighborhoods helps you get to know how to spot a deal/interact with it

Rehabbing criteria:

1. Proximity to your house/travel time.
2. Selling prices of the homes in the neighborhood (higher better)
3. Sales activity of the homes in the neighborhood (higher better). 
   If low days on market, high demand, people are moving in. High days on market, low demand, people moving out.
4. Ages of the homes in the neighborhood (too new is bad, too old is bad)
5. Appeal and charm of the neighborhood (homeowner pride)
6. Safety of the neighborhood

Rental criteria:

1. Population makeup - ethnicity, age, demographics, crime, growing, etc
2. Job market diversified? (If a big company pulls out of the area, will jobs be lost?)
3. New companies moving in or out soon? Any big events trending soon?
4. Housing market - Are prices going up? Look for a low foreclosure %
5. Look for a low cost of living.
6. What is the vacancy rate of the city?
7. Any special conditions? Flood zone, or hurricane prone (Florida, etc)

PROCESS - Assess Property Value (ARV)
-------------------------------------------
1. Get the Comps. Ask agent to run a CMA (Comparative Market Analysys) report. Based on:

   1. Within the past 6 months
   2. Close proximity
   3. Similar size (sq feet)
   4. Similar Layout (2 bed 1 bath)
   5. Similar year built

2. Drive to the Comps and use your eyes. See if they're better or worse than your property using:

   1. Condition. Roof, garage doors, windows, driveway, walkways, porches
   2. Curb Appeal. The architecute, trees, lawn, landscaping, lot size, and grade
   3. View. Water, city skyline, mountains, any eyesores
   4. Street. Cul-de-sac, major street, major intersecion, pride of ownership evident
   5. Proximity to Infrastructure. Commercial businesses, factories, undesirable establishments, highways, 
      power lines, parking lots, bus stops etc.

3. Read the Market. Today, 6 month forecast? Some things to consider are:

   1. Mortgate rate trends. Are rates going up or down in next 6 months? Higher rates drop home prices
   2. Seasonal buying cylcle. Home sales usually take a dip during winter months, but pick up in the summer.
   3. Time on market. Ask realtor for time on market - average time sitting - slow or fast
   4. Developments. Anything that will cause people to want to move in or leave? Major employers, schools, 
      stores, churches, parks, pools, entertainment value

4. Check with Experts. Check with local experts. Some to consider are:

   1. Neighborhood Realtors. Agents who specialize in that neighborhood.
   2. Appraisers. Get an actual appraisal (\$300-500). See if you can just get a verbal appraisal for a discount. 
      Let them know you are looking for the ARV, not current condition.
   3. Neighborhod Residents. Talk to people who live there.

How to use MLS, Redfin, and Zillow to find Properties
-----------------------------------------------------------
Filter by Recently Sold Houses for the cheapest possible. Gather all this data
and try to figure out why they sold so cheap. Use it as your baseline for the
neighborhood. 

Do the same for fixed up or recently remodelled houses. Use it as your baseline for
rehabbed properties.

You want to be in a neighborhood with a lot of investor activity.

--------------------
There is a walkthrough using Listsource to see the highest concentrations of Investor activity
in the book "Finding and Funding great deals"

MLS:
----------------
I look for vacant properties that have been on the mls for 90 days or more and have had big price reductions. 
I determine what I can pay and make a cash offer regardless of asking price. I get 3 out of 10 this way. 
Often if they turn down the offer initially they will come back around  later and take the offer. 

You can automate this by training a REALTOR® on your parameters and have them make the offers or you.
