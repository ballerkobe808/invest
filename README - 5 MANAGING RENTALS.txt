Questions to Ask Property Management Companies

1. Can you tell me more about your property management company?
   (How much experience do they have?) How do you handle problems - how big are you? Processes in place..? How long have you been in business? How big is your company - amount of people and roles? Do you have electronic and automated systems set up? Direct Deposit?

2. What are the fees?
   Setup fee - say \$300 to open account - Monthly 8%-12%? Is this on rent Collected, or rent due, rent scheduled, rent value, etc. It should be on rent collected to assure not paying when there is no rent. Vacancy Fee? Listing/new tenant fee? Lease renewal fee? Is there evection insurance? What do you charge for evictions? How are they handled? Any other fees?
   What about late fees? How much and who gets them - owner or prop management company.

3. How many properties are you managing? Do you manage both short-term and long-term rentals?
   These days, many property managers are involved with managing short-term rentals through sites like Airbnb and VRBO. Short-term rentals are a different business and can take up a lot of a property manager’s time. Make sure they have the time to focus on your long-term rentals.

4. Whats your typical process to advertise and fill the properties?
   How long does it take you to turn a property around in between tenants? Can you do it in 24 hours or does the owner have to lose weeks to a month of rent every time a tenant change occurs? Tenant screening - Criminal and background checks? Take photos before and after tenant moves in and out
   How do you determine rent amount?

5. How do you handle tenant calls for repairs?
   How do you handle maintenance and yard work?
   What is your philosophy on repairs and replacement?
   Do you try to solve the problem before sending out a repair person?
   Who do you use for repairs? Electrical, plumbing, appliances?
   Do they have a handy man that they try to use for most repairs or do they use outside vendors? If they have a skilled handy man you may get quality work for less.
   How do you handle yard work? Is your property manager up to the task or is it something tenants should handle?

6. Do you conduct routine property inspections?
   Property inspections help you catch problems and conduct maintenance before it’s too late. Whether it’s checking on how tenants are treating your spaces or ensuring that appliances and utilities are functioning correctly, spaces need to be kept in the best shape possible to prevent costly renovations and assure that the space isn’t being misused in any way.

7. What rental management tool do you use?
   Rental management software is helpful for streamlining management processes and increasing profits, making it an excellent tool for any professional property manager.

8. Do you have any rental properties of your own?
   While it may seem beneficial for a property manager to have their own rental properties, according to Peter Giardini, this is actually a bad idea.

## Security Deposits in Indianapolis

### What Can I Keep the Security Deposit For?

Obviously, there are certain instances where you can deduct all or part of the Security Deposit from the Tenant. The official law states that Landlords in Indiana may keep Security Deposits for the following purposes:

1. To reimburse the landlord for actual damages to the rental unit or any ancillary facility that are not the result of ordinary wear and tear.

2. To pay the landlord for: (A) all rent in arrearage under the rental agreement; and (B) rent due for premature termination of the rental agreement by the tenant.

3. To pay for the last payment period of a residential rental agreement if a written agreement between the landlord and the tenant stipulates that the security deposit will serve as the last payment of rent due.

4. To reimburse the landlord for utility or sewer charges paid by the landlord that are: (A) the obligation of the tenant under the rental agreement; and (B) unpaid by the tenant

So, while there is some good guidance here, there is a lot left to interpretation as well, especially when assessing what is "normal wear and tear."

This is where you will need to construct your Lease with exactly what you expect when the Tenant leaves. Should the carpets be professionally cleaned? Should the house be fully cleaned?

Further, you will need to adopt some standards on certain items like paint and flooring. If a Tenant lives in your property for 3 years and the home needs painted upon move-out, should the Tenant bear any of this responsibility?

These are important and tricky considerations that you need to determine as soon as you decide to become a Landlord.

### How Do I Refund the Deposit?

Again, it’s state-driven. In Indiana, you have 45 days after the lease end date and the Tenant has vacated to return the deposit in full or provide a letter noting what deductions were made from that Security Deposit.

If you’ve read my previous blog on wear and tear, this is where that information becomes business-man-3160009_1920.jpgextremely important. If your security deposit is $1,000 and you feel like the Tenant did $200 of damage outside of normal wear and tear, you’ll need to refund the $800 within 45 days and provide documentation on how that $200 was spent.

### What if I Don't Refund the Security Deposit within 45 days?

If you, as the Landlord, fail to return the deposit or send a letter itemizing what the deposit was used for within the allotted 45 days, then you leave yourself open for a lawsuit.

The Tenant has the right to sue you in small claims court for the full amount of the deposit and you will be forced to claim that no damages are due, with the exception of unpaid rent.

As a Landlord in Indiana, you don't have a ton of guidance on the matter of security deposits. You can combat this by A) Knowing and understanding what laws Indiana does have regarding security deposits and B) Developing a system and process that you will adhere to consistently from Tenant to Tenant.

Remember, the security deposit is the Tenant's money.
