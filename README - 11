When you transfer your property from your name to your LLC 

1. Transfer the deed
2. Home Insurance - add the LLC to your insurance 
3. Title Insurance policy - add LLC as additional insured
4. Due on sale clause - be aware of this
5. If you sign any contracts - sign as your LLC not yourself (leases prop management agreements are examples)
   Now you need to put these in your name
   Put clauses in the lease and prop management to be able to assign to someone else (so you can put into an LLC)
6. Dont comingle assets - sep bank accounts etc
put money in the LLC and have the LLC pay the person doing the work
Make sure the rent goes into the LLC

Get a estoppel - an agreement that the tenant says thats the lease. More common in commercial than in residential

Be aware of estate planning and living trust - whoever does the LLC, make sure they are aware of this
Alternative - is to transfer to a land trust

For lending - careful of being in LLC, then going to your name - now you only owned it for a day, 
so you might have to wait the 6 months or more seasoning to qualify for the loan.

Try not to put your name on the LLC if possible - usually not needed, so dont if you dont need to.
Subscription agreement - you get 100 shares in your LLC?
you dont own the LLC, you own shares of the LLC


Property management agreement - make sure there is a clause for attorney fees in case for evictions

Sometimes the lease is between the prop manager and the tenant so the prop manager can take care of stuff.
This COULD be an issue if the prop manager doesnt do his job - you dont have a contract with the tenant.

Eviction Process
