# REHAB

## Assessing the cost of rehab

Step through the house and get an estimate of the repairs needed.
Book "Flip" has a good list of things to consider.

There is also software with a 500 point checklist that you can go thru to help estimate it faster.
HomeFixers Cost Assessment Report. If you have an affiliate in the city (homefixers.com), you can order a HomeFixers Cost Assessment Report. You can also buy the software.
