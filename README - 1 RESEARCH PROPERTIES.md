### 1.2.2.1. PROCESS - Assess the Neighborhoods Desirability

Targeting neighborhoods helps you get to know how to spot a deal/interact with it

Rehabbing criteria:

1. Proximity to your house/travel time.
2. Selling prices of the homes in the neighborhood (higher better)
3. Sales activity of the homes in the neighborhood (higher better)
4. Ages of the homes in the neighborhood (too new is bad, too old is bad)
5. Appeal and charm of the neighborhood (homeowner pride)
6. Safety of the neighborhood

Rental criteria:

1. Population makeup - ethnicity, age, demographics, crime, growing, etc
2. Job market diversified? (If a big company pulls out of the area, will jobs be lost?)
3. New companies moving in or out soon? Any big events trending soon?
4. Housing market - Are prices going up? Look for a low foreclosure %
5. Look for a low cost of living.
6. What is the vacancy rate of the city?
7. Any special conditions? Flood zone, or hurricane prone (Florida, etc)

### PROCESS - Assess Property Value (ARV)

1. Get the Comps. Ask agent to run a CMA (Comparative Market Analysys) report. Based on:

   1. Within the past 6 months
   2. Close proximity
   3. Similar size (sq feet)
   4. Similar Layout (2 bed 1 bath)
   5. Similar year built

2. Drive to the Comps and use your eyes. See if they're better or worse than your property using:

   1. Condition. Roof, garage doors, windows, driveway, walkways, porches
   2. Curb Appeal. The architecute, trees, lawn, landscaping, lot size, and grade
   3. View. Water, city skyline, mountains, any eyesores
   4. Street. Cul-de-sac, major street, major intersecion, pride of ownership evident
   5. Proximity to Infrastructure. Commercial businesses, factories, undesirable establishments, highways, power lines, parking lots, bus stops etc.

3. Read the Market. Today, 6 month forecast? Some things to consider are:

   1. Mortgate rate trends. Are rates going up or down in next 6 months? Higher rates drop home prices
   2. Seasonal buying cylcle. Home sales usually take a dip during winter months, but pick up in the summer.
   3. Time on market. Ask realtor for time on market - average time sitting - slow or fast
   4. Developments. Anything that will cause people to want to move in or leave? Major employers, schools, stores, churches, parks, pools, entertainment value

4. Check with Experts. Check with local experts. Some to consider are:

   1. Neighborhood Realtors. Agents who specialize in that neighborhood.
   2. Appraisers. Get an actual appraisal ($300-500). See if you can just get a verbal appraisal for a discount. Let them know you are looking for the ARV, not current condition.
   3. Neighborhod Residents. Talk to people who live there.

### PROCESS - Assess the rehab costs

Very important - and also easy to get wrong!

1. Hire a professional. This will be the most expensive, but maybe the most worth it.

2. Do it yourself or ask a Realtor. Cost of materials and cost of construction itself. Also some tasks require specialists (faoundations, structural, septic, well, chimney, pool, etc) Do enough of these however, and you will get better and better at it. Like anything, the more experience and data points you have. Always add at least a 5% contingency for unforseen costs or overruns.

3. Use a rule of thumb. Only use this if you need to do it overnight - time is of the essence.
   1. Make-hab ($5/square foot, $3-7) Clean out, paint, carpet, final cleaning
   2. Rehab ($15/square foot, $12-18) Mostly cosmetic, broken windows, leaky roof, HVAC, electrial, plumbinb, doorknobs, doorstops, bathroom accessories, tile, refurbishing cabinetry, trim, landscaping.
   3. Remodel ($25/square foot, $20-30) Rehab plus replacing bathtub, walk in showers, cabinetry, doors, trim, widening openingss.
   4. Restructure ($40/square foot, $35-45) Remodel plus major layout changes - moving a bathroom increasing kitchen, building an addition, etc.

Use the Homefixers app to estimate easier. Maybe can order a HomeFixers Cost Assessment Report depending on the city. https://househackerpro.com/upgrade.html

NOTE: Other costs to include with the rehab are the costs of closing (Closing fees, inspections -1.5%), Holding (Taxes, Utilities, HOA fees, etc - 1.5%), Lending fees (variable), and if flipping, then Selling Fees (6.5% selling price)

Estimate the time it will take to fix: Get the cost per square foot and divide by 10 - that will be how many months it will take. Add two and a half months to market and sell.

Estimating minimum amount of profit - 10% of selling price PLUS an additional amount depending on the complexity of the rehab. A good rule of thumb is to add 1% for every $5/square foot of rehab cost.

### Interview Turnkey/Owner

Find out what the turnkey provider or owner is like. Big question is if you can trust them. Lots of times just trying to gauge that - competency and trust.

Questions

- [Reputation on Bigger Pockets]
- Start with open-ended questions and just try to let them talk - get a gauge on them
- Can you tell me more about your company?
- What is your role in the process? Buy? Rehab? Sell? Property Management? Why are you selling?
- How do you vet your actual providers? (if they have some)
- Ask them "What separates you from other companies?"
- Can you send me the rent rolls, of current/previous tenants
- What kind of shape is the property in? Has any work been done recently? Do you have any documentation of that?

- Do you own the property? If not, who is the company/person who is selling it? Always better selling their own
- Was the property rehabbed? Who did the rehab? Always better to know the rehab workmanship personally
- Does it currently need any repairs? If so, what do you think the estimated costs will be?
- Can you tell me a little more about the neighborhood (want them to describe it in their own terms)
- Big 6 Cap Exp Questions - Find facts and also get a feel on how they answer. Ask Hey ball park numbers, what would it cost to redo the roof, etc - just to get a feel. 1 Roof, 2 HVAC, 3 Foundation, 4 Plumbing, 5 Electrical, 6 Termites

### Property Management & Questions to ask

Find out more about the property management team and make sure you are comfortable working with them. Nothing is more important to the success of your property or peace of mind, than the property management company and their communication, responsiveness, and committment to excellence. Good chance this guy doesn't care about your investment - make sure you are comfortable here - find the right team!

Questions:

- Can you tell me more about your property management company? (How much experience do they have?) How do you handle problems - how big are you? Processes in place..?
- What are the fees? Setup fee - say $300 to open account - Monthly 8%-12%? Is this on rent Collected, or rent due, rent scheduled, rent value, etc. It should be on rent collected to assure not paying when there is no rent. Vacancy Fee? Listing/new tenant fee? Lease renewal fee? Maintenance fees? Eviction fee?
- What is their average vacancy rate? (Charge when there is a vacancy?) So important to keep rentals filled...
- Are there Tenants currently? (Rent Rolls available?) (Lease Agreements?) How sure is the rental price? If you are unsure here, then call around for property managers in the area and get their opinion - you can possibly go with one of them if you like them as well (Yelp is a good resource).
- Ask a question about how they would handle a specific problem to see if they will try to save you money or just hire a plumber and be done with it. How much do they care?
