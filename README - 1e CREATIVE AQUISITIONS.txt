Master Lease

- If you buy an option, put (record) a memorandum on the title so owner cant sell it


  3 Options that will tenant will choose at the end

  1. choose not to buy
  2. choose to buy and use a bank
  3. choose to buy and use you as the bank

  The target tenant will be someone with 2300-4400 set aside for housing, that are looking to get their life 
  back on track.
  You kinda want a home that a family will live in, so at least 3/2 in hawaii, also safe neighborhoods

  4 Types of Income from Lease Option

  1. Non-refundable Option Payment (PCF)
  2. Monthly Rent
  3. Sale price is pre-negotiated and agreed upon by all parties
