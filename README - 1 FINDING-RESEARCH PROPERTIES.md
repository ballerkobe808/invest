## 1.1. PROCESS - Finding a Property (Generating Leads)

## Find a property

Always be on the lookout! Finding good deals is the most important part of investing

Keep researching and looking at real estate - constantly collect data points - the more you see, the better your instinct on what a good deal is becomes (you need to internalize this)

### 1.1.1. What am I looking for (Initial Property filter)

Deals are made on the initial purchase. If you make a good purcahse you can make a profit. If you dont make a good purchase, you can't do much - just salvage your loss.

Things you are looking for in a property:

1. The house needs upgrade/repair
2. It is in an area of town where people want to live
3. The owner is motivated to sell under market value

#### Finding the right Neighborhood

#### My Personal Rental Portfolio

- Single/Multifamily Rentals with over 1.2% Rent to Value ratio (in the 50-120k range).
- Solid Property Management - either in place or able to connect with some (So important! This is a make or break aspect - can make life terrible or awesome later)
- Great Locations!! This is very important. I want somewhere that people will want to rent, and that will be easy to manage. Money on a spreadsheet is not money in your hand. One eviction could cost you thousands. Stay away from bad neighborhoods, high vacancy areas. Need a local's perspective here - the agent or property manager. It can be tempting to just look at numbers, but go for a lower ROI, and less headaches. Making a bad decision here can come back to bite you later (learn from other people's mistakes)

### 1.1.2. Finding the Deal

#### PROCESS - Find a Good Agent

Finding a quality Realtor to work with in the area you are looking for will be so vital to your success. One way is to look on Zillow (Zillow.com/agent-finder.) or Yelp and send an email to the agent with the following information:

1. That you are an investor who understands real estate
2. What specifically you are looking for
3. How you intend to purchase (loan, cash, and so on)
4. How you heard about the agent

Sample Email:

Sort through possible agents, and find one that will be able to bring you good deals. Also look at it from his/her point of view too. What is he/she getting - will you be doing a lot of business, bringing business their way? Rewarding them with extra compensation or helping them out too? Be aware of what value u bring to the transaction.

#### Current Agents/Leads

THESE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN THE PIPELINE! Finding a good deal is so vital to your success. Make sure to reward and appreciate these people for their contributions.

- Sarah Rudy - Prop Manager/Realtor/Owner turnkeyonline
  Lee Waters - Realtor

- Jonathan - Reitrader

- Lane Kawaoka

#### Alternative Avenues

- Turnkey Providers (Norada, ReiTrader, JWB, Midsouth Homebuyers, Memphis Invest)
- Craigslist, MLS, Auction com, Hubzoo, beaurou of conveyances

## 1.2. Researching a Property

#### 1.2.2.1. PROCESS - Assess the Neighborhoods Desirability

Targeting neighborhoods - This will help you to focus your efforts and become an expert somewhere.

For Rehabbing, here are criteria of a good neighborhood

1. Proximity to your work and home
2. Selling prices of the homes in the neighborhood
3. Sales activity of the homes in the neighborhood
4. Ages of the homes in the neighborhood
5. Appeal and charm of the neighborhood
6. Safety of the neighborhood

For Rentals, here are things to consider

- Population makeup - ethnicity, age, demographics, crime, etc.
- Population growth? Is it growing?
- Is the Job market diversified? (If a big company pulls out of the area, will jobs be lost?)
- Any new companies moving in or out soon? Any big events trending soon?
- Housing market - Are prices going up? Also look for a low foreclosure %
- Look for a low cost of living.
- What is the vacancy rate of the city?
- Any special conditions? Flood zone, or hurricane prone (Florida, etc)
- Nice graphic about appreciation and cashflow here: [link image]

### 1.2.1. PROCESS - Step by Step Guide to QUICKLY gather data

- Look it up on Zillow, Redfin, Trulia, realtor.com, (MLS if you can)
- Walk the neighborhood with Google Street map view
- Look up rents in the area using Rentometer.com, Craigslist and Hotpads
- Find the property tax records (Zillow or County's tax site)
- Find the areas desirability (NeighborhoodScout.com, Walkscore.com)
- Find insurance prices Email/call my insurance agent (allstate, etc) with the property address and asking for the largest deductable/smallest monthly payment. Or Google "investor homeowners insurance Atlanta", read the reviews and call the highest reviewed one.
- Find a local Realtor/Property Manager and speak to them (Look them up on Yelp)
- Look up a record of past permits online (County's site)
- IMPORTANT Does it make sense from a numbers and also effort perspective.

### 1.2.2. Deeper Dive into Property (Things to Consider)

#### PROCESS - Assess Property Value (ARV)

1. Get the Comps. Ask agent to run a CMA (Comparative Market Analysys) report. The CMA should be based on:

   1. Within the past 6 months
   2. Close proximity
   3. Similar size (sq feet)
   4. Similar Layout (2 bed 1 bath)
   5. Similar year built

2. Drive to the Comps and compare using your eyes. See if its better or worse than your property using:

   1. Condition. Roof, garage doors, windows, driveway, walkways, porches
   2. Curb Appeal. The architecute, trees, lawn, landscaping, lot size, and grade
   3. View. Water, city skyline, mountains, any eyesores
   4. Street. Cul-de-sac, major street, major intersecion, pride of ownership evident
   5. Proximity to Infrastructure. Commercial businesses, factories, undesirable establishments, highways, power lines, parking lots, bus stops etc.

3. Read the Market. What does it look like today, and what is the 6 month forecast? Some things to consider are:

   1. Mortgate rate trends. Are rates going up or down in next 6 months? Higher rates drop home prices
   2. Seasonal buying cylcle. Home sales usually take a dip during winter months, but pick up in the summer.
   3. Time on market. Your realtor can check inventory levels and see average days on market to see how quickly things are selling
   4. Developments. Is there anything that will cause people to want to move in or leave? Major employers, schools, stores, churches, parks, pools, entertainment value

4. Check with Experts. Check with local experts. Some to consider are:

   1. Neighborhood Realtors. Agents who specialize in that neighborhood.
   2. Appraisers. Get an actual appraisal ($300-500). See if you can just get a verbal appraisal for a discount. Let them know you are looking for the ARV, not current condition.
   3. Neighborhod Residents. Talk to people who live there.

#### PROCESS - Assess the rehab costs

This is the area that investors most get wrong. If done incorrectly it will eat into profits and schedule and cost a lot more than just the rehab itself.

Three options to calculate them are:

1. Hire a professional. This will be the most expensive, but maybe the most worth it, especially to start out.

2. Do it yourself. Cost of materials and cost of construction itself. Also some tasks require specialists (faoundations, structural, septic, well, chimney, pool, etc) Do enough of these however, and you will get better and better at it. Like anything, the more experience and data points you have. Always at at least a 5% contingency for unforseen costs or overruns.

3. Use a rule of thumb. Only use this if you need to do it overnight - time is of the essence.
   1. Make-hab ($5/square foot, $3-7) Clean out, paint, carpet, final cleaning
   2. Rehab ($15/square foot, $12-18) Mostly cosmetic, broken windows, leaky roof, HVAC, electrial, plumbinb, doorknobs, doorstops, bathroom accessories, tile, refurbishing cabinetry, trim, landscaping.
   3. Remodel ($25/square foot, $20-30) Rehab plus replacing bathtub, walk in showers, cabinetry, doors, trim, widening openingss.
   4. Restructure ($40/square foot, $35-45) Remodel plus major layout changes - moving a bathroom increasing kitchen, building an addition, etc.

There is also software with a 500 point checklist that you can go thru to help estimate it faster.
HomeFixers Cost Assessment Report. If you have an affiliate in the city (homefixers.com), you can order a HomeFixers Cost Assessment Report. You can also buy the software.

NOTE: Other costs to include with the rehab are the costs of closing (Closing fees, inspections -1.5%), Holding (Taxes, Utilities, HOA fees, etc - 1.5%), Lending fees (variable), and if flipping, then Selling Fees (6.5% selling price)

A Good way to estimate the time it will take to fix is to get the cost per square foot and divide by 10 - that will be how many months it will take. Add two and a half months to market and sell for a flip.

When estimating minimum amount of profit - use 10% of selling price PLUS an additional amount depending on the complexity of the rehab. A good rule of thumb is to add 1% for every $5/square foot of rehab cost.

#### 1.2.2.4. Property Management & Questions to ask

- Find out more about the property management team and make sure you are comfortable working with them, and they have reasonable rates. Nothing is more important to the success of your property or peace of mind, than the property management company and their communication, responsiveness, and committment to excellence. Good chance this guy doesn't care about your investment - make sure you are comfortable here - find the right team!

Questions:

- Can you tell me more about your property management company? (How much experience do they have?) How do you handle problems - how big are you? Processes in place..?
- What are the fees? Setup fee - say $300 to open account - Monthly 8%-12%? Is this on rent Collected, or rent due, rent scheduled, rent value, etc. It should be on rent collected to assure not paying when there is no rent. Vacancy Fee? Listing/new tenant fee? Lease renewal fee? Maintenance fees? Eviction fee?
- What is their average vacancy rate? (Charge when there is a vacancy?) So important to keep rentals filled...
- Are there Tenants currently? (Rent Rolls available?) (Lease Agreements?) How sure is the rental price? If you are unsure here, then call around for property managers in the area and get their opinion - you can possibly go with one of them if you like them as well (Yelp is a good resource). Also Hotpads research surrounding similar rentals.

#### 1.2.2.2. PROCESS Turnkey/Owner Conversations and Questions.

- Vetting the Turnkey Vendor will make life easier in the long run. Find out as much as you can about them as a company to see if you can work with them, or thier providers.
- What is their repuation like on Bigger Pockets?

Questions

- Start with open-ended questions and just try to let them talk - get a gauge on them
- Can you tell me more about your company?
- What is your role in the process? Buy? Rehab? Sell? Property Management? (This always better if they own the entire process - makes it easier to find a point of contact and back up their work)
- If you are a middle man, how do you vet the actual providers?
- Ask them "What separates you from other companies?"
- Ask for rent rolls, of current previous tenants
- Ask for documenation of work done on the house recently

- Do you own the property? If not, who is the company/person who is selling it? Always better selling their own
- Was the property rehabbed? Who did the rehab? Always better to know the rehab workmanship personally
- Does it currently need any repairs? If so, what do you think the estimated costs will be?
- Can you tell me a little more about the neighborhood (want them to describe it in their own terms)
- Big 6 Cap Exp Questions - Find facts and also get a feel on how they answer. Ask Hey ball park numbers, what would it cost to redo the roof, etc - just to get a feel. 1 Roof, 2 HVAC, 3 Foundation, 4 Plumbing, 5 Electrical, 6 Termites

There are three steps to a foreclosure

1. Preforeclosure. The property is listed to be sold at a public auction. Investors can purchase directly from the seller during the preforeclosure period.

2. Public Auction. The property iss put up for public auction, usually at the county courthouse. Investors bid on the property.

3. Real Estate Owned. If the property doesn't sell at auction, it goes back to the lender. Investors can purchase the property from the lender.

- U.S Dept of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
- Veterans Administration (VA)
- Federal Housing Authority (FHA)
- Federal National Mortgage Insurance Association (Fannie Mae)
- Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac)
