## 1.1. PROCESS - Finding a Property (Generating Leads)

## Look for properties

Always be on the lookout! Finding good deals is the most important part of investing

Keep researching and looking at real estate - constantly collect data points - the more you see, the better your instinct on what a good deal is becomes (you need to internalize this)

### 1.1.1. What am I looking for (Initial Property filter)

- Single/Multifamily Rentals with over 1.2% Rent to Value ratio (in the 50-120k range).
- Solid Property Management - either in place or able to connect with some (So important! This is a make or break aspect - can make life terrible or awesome later)
- Great Locations!! This is very important. I want somewhere that people will want to rent, and that will be easy to manage. Money on a spreadsheet is not money in your hand. One eviction could cost you thousands. Stay away from bad neighborhoods, high vacancy areas, Need a local's perspective here - the ageny ot property manager. It can be tempting to just look at numbers, but go for a lower ROI, but less headaches. Making a bad decision here can come back to bite you later (learn from other people's mistakes)

### 1.1.2. Finding the Deal

#### PROCESS - Find a Good Agent

Finding a quality Realtor to work with in the area you are looking for will be so vital to your success. One way is to look on Zillow (Zillow.com/agent-finder.) or yelp and send an email to the agent with the following information:

1. That you are an investor who understands real estate
2. What specifically you are looking for
3. How you intend to purchase (loan, cash, and so on)
4. How you heard about the agent

Sample Email:

Sort through possible agents, and find one that will be able to bring you good deals. Also look at it from his/her point of view too. What is he/she getting - will you be doing a lot of business, bringing business their way? Rewarding them with extra compensation or helping them out too? Be aware of what value u bring to the transaction.

#### Current Agents/Leads

- Vetting the Turnkey Vendor will make life easier in the long run. Find out as much as you can about them as a company to see if you can work with them, or thier providers.
- What is their repuation like on Bigger Pockets?

Questions

- Start with open-ended questions and just try to let them talk - get a gauge on them
- Can you tell me more about your company?
- What is your role in the process? Buy? Rehab? Sell? Property Management? (This always better if they own the entire process - makes it easier to find a point of contact and back up their work)
- If you are a middle man, how do you vet the actual providers?
- Ask them "What separates you from other companies?"
- Ask for rent rolls, of current previous tenants
- Ask for documenation of work done on the house recently

#### 1.2.2.3. Property Value & Questions to ask

- Pass the initial property filter in the "What am I looking for" section above
- Plug values into the Investment Calculator - good margin? (Want 200 positive cashflow)
- Does the property need repairs currently? Will it soon?
- Deals are made going in - Make sure its a good investment!! You can always find another..
- Best value around the 100k range. Too cheap and you get issues? Also as you go lower in price % maint and % cap exp go down - even tho things will cost around the same...
- Truepeoplesearch - find the person owning the property and contact them directly?

Questions:

- Do you own the property? If not, who is the company/person who is selling it? Always better selling their own
- Was the property rehabbed? Who did the rehab? Always better to know the rehab workmanship personally
- Does it currently need any repairs? If so, what do you think the estimated costs will be?
- Can you tell me a little more about the neighborhood (want them to describe it in their own terms)
- Big 6 Cap Exp Questions - Find facts and also get a feel on how they answer. Ask Hey ball park numbers, what would it cost to redo the roof, etc - just to get a feel. 1 Roof, 2 HVAC, 3 Foundation, 4 Plumbing, 5 Electrical, 6 Termites

#### 1.2.2.4. Property Management & Questions to ask

- Find out more about the property management team and make sure you are comfortable working with them, and they have reasonable rates. Nothing is more important to the success of your property or peace of mind, than the property management company and their communication, responsiveness, and committment to excellence. Good chance this guy doesn't care about your investment - make sure you are comfortable here - find the right team!

Questions:

- Can you tell me more about your property management company? (How much experience do they have?) How do you handle problems - how big are you? Processes in place..?
- What are the fees? Setup fee - say $300 to open account - Monthly 8%-12%? Is this on rent Collected, or rent due, rent scheduled, rent value, etc. It should be on rent collected to assure not paying when there is no rent. Vacancy Fee? Listing/new tenant fee? Lease renewal fee? Maintenance fees? Eviction fee?
- What is their average vacancy rate? (Charge when there is a vacancy?) So important to keep rentals filled...
- Are there Tenants currently? (Rent Rolls available?) (Lease Agreements?) How sure is the rental price? If you are unsure here, then call around for property managers in the area and get their opinion - you can possibly go with one of them if you like them as well (Yelp is a good resource). Also Hotpads research surrounding similar rentals.
