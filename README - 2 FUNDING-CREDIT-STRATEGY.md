## 1.1. Getting Funding

There are many tools to choose from when deciding how to fund deals. Some options are loans from banks, credit unions, portfolio banks, hard money lenders, friends/family/partners, lines of credit, credit cards,
401k/IRA, seller financing.

Use Getfundedonline.com - to find the best instiutions and programs to apply to.

Get as much funding as you can when possible. Its easier to take out 100k from the start, versus going for 20k, 20k, 40k, 20k in succession. There is a cool story/illustration of borrowing money from your friend using both methods.

### 1.1.1. PROCESS - Collect and organize needed documents/records

Get all the documents you will need and into an organized folder

- W2s for the last 2 years
- 2 months of all Bank Statements (has to be full statements - not printed html)
- 2 paychecks of current employer(s)
- 401k Statment(s)
- Any stock or investment statements
- Documentation on existing loans and properties
- Aalii contract and agreement?
- Proof of Federal Tax payment

### 1.1.2. PROCESS - Find a Lender

1. Google search Local Lenders near your property:

   Investor-friendly banks (county you are looking in)
   Credit union (county you are looking in)
   Savings and loan institution (county you are looking in)
   Portfolio lender (county you are looking in)

2. Send them an email like this:

   ![](lib/Letter to Prospective Credit Union or Lender.png)

3. See if you can form a partnership and relationship with them, and refer others to them. Make sure everyone knows you are the connector.

NOTE: Lane Kawaoka said certain banks wont fund investments, so its better to go with ones that are familiar with the process and the risk.

### 1.1.3. Current Lenders

- Quicken Loans -
  (Caution - promised 15% down early - changed to 25% when actual loan and tried to push super high fees through - luckily i read the documents - Be Careful of Sales people here!!!)

- Highlands Mortgage -

- Ridge Lending -

- Bank of Hawaii -

- University of Hawaii Federal Credit Union -
  Great option to park money, or take out personal loans, credit cards, or even a mortgage at a really good rate.
  Savings Account with 1% APY (applied monthly).
  5-7.5% APR personal loans (up to 5x gross monthly income)
  8.5% Credit Card!!! (10k max)
  Car Loans - Can refinance too, but need full insurance

### 1.1.4. Get Pre-qualification letter

Fill out the lenders application and get the prequalification letter.

### 1.1.5. Get Approved for a specific property

When you find the property you want to buy, begin the acutal loan application process. Send the contract over to the lender for review.

Some questions to review:

    What is the length of the loan? (30 yrs, 27, etc)
    What is the rate? (APR%)
    Origination Fee? Other fees?
    Any points up front?
    Is there a pre-payment penalty?

## 1.2. Sources and Types of Funding

### 1.2.1. Line of Credit (HELOC, or Personal LOC)

    The key thing to note, is that an LOC's interest is calculated PER DAY.
    You can get the daily interest by taking the APR (Example: 2.7%), dividing by 12 - to get the monthly interest, then dividing that by 30 to get the daily interest. (They do it like this vs dividing by 365 according to the renautus guys).

    Take out a line of credit at your local bank. For First Hawaiian Bank you can get one for 20k assuming your DTI is ok. If you want to go higher, you will have to provide some bank statements.

### 1.2.2. HElOC

HELOCs are Home Equity Lines of Credit. It is a line of credit against the equity in your property that is above the 20% amount. You must always have at least 20% in equity in your property. Any equity over this 20% can be used as collateral for a line of credit against it. Example:

1. 100k home, with 20k of my money/equity. Since I'm at 20% and have nothing above the 20%, I cannot get a HELOC
2. 100k home, with 40k of my money/equity. Since I'm over the 20% threshold by 20k, I can get a HELOC for 20k
3. 100k home, with 80k of my money/equity. Since I'm over the 20% threshold by 60k, i can get a HELOC for 60k

These often come with low 1.7-2% introductory APRs for the first year. You can do strategic things here - Use that money to quickly pay off principle in another loan, and then pay this HELOC off using the lower % rate. Hawaii is known for really low APRs.

Once the introductory rate is over, you can pay it off or cancel and open another HELOC with another bank lol.

One thing to note is that HELOC % is calculated by the day, so any balance used in a month will be charged interest. Credit Cards on the other hand are only charged interest at the end of the month. Because of this, use your Credit Card for daily purchases and only use your HELOC to pay off your CC as needed. Credit Card will also return points on purchases.

Combine a HELOC, with a CC, and Mortgage to do a Velocity Banking Strategy. Open a HELOC, and use a huge chunk to pay off the mortgage principle (same property or another - the earlier the loan section the bigger the payoff). Keep a zero balance in your checking. Any day to day activities, use your CC to pay it off. At the end of the month use the HELOC to pay the CC balance. Any extra income goes toward paying down the HELOC balance. Get it to zero before the rate rises. Cancel, then open another HELOC at the introductory rate. Garret Taira perfected this strategy.

Banks will probably not fund your Rentals - you will need to go to a portfolio lender or open a business line of credit.

### 1.2.3. 401k/IRA (Individual Retirement Account)

- Pretax dollars put here (so you get more bang for your buck)
- Reduces income tax (money contributed is not counted as income)
- Must be 60 to withdraw penalty free, otherwise 10% penalty
- Roth means you put in after tax dollars
- 401k - 18k limit as of 2017, IRA 5.5k limit as of 2017
- Compound interest is POWERFUL!!!

#### 1.2.3.1. Datahouse 401k

- Datahouse is matching 20% of your investment up to 2400. Its added as a lump sum once a year in July.
- You have been averaging 10% yearly returns from your mutual funds investment.
- You can stop any time, but open enrollment is Dec to change amounts (for Jan implementation)

#### 1.2.3.2. Borrowing from your 401k

- You can borrow either 50% or 50k - whichever is less
- You have to pay back in 5 years unless its for a primary residence, or hardship, or special circumstance
- You will pay back interest but the interest all goes back to you
- If you quit or are fired, you have to pay it back in 60 days or incur a penalty
- Penalty for early withdrawal is 10%??
- When you take it out for real, you pay income tax on it (Unless its a Roth)

## 1.3. CREDIT

---

### 1.3.1. Types of Credit

1. Personal Credit
   personal guarantee
   report to personal reports
   tend to have lower limits

2. Business Credit
   personal guarantee
   does not report to personal repors
   better limits

3. Corp Credit
   no personal guarantee
   does not report to personal reports
   best limits
   harder to get

### 1.3.2. Credit Score

Definition - "A numerical representation that you will become 90 days late within the next two years"
Important idea - "Good Credit is NOT just Not Bad Credit". Common misperception. You have to Build good credit.
There are a lot of ways to get your "credit score". Each lender will use a different criteria or calculation.
You don't actually have a "Credit Score". Its just a report that is calculated at that moment depending on a number of factors.

There will always be errors in your credit report - its interesing how they get data (look at ALL the data then take away everything that is definitely not you) - broken algorithm - research this.
last name, first initial - date of birth - ssn
Its often File Merge items vs identity theft that affect you...

Identify theft - most of the time its a relative, child, parents, etc. But when people get ahold of your account and make unauthorized charges, its often considered identity theft too. But its usually not "identity theft" - more "hacked accounts".
2 ways to view the world - live in fear constantly OR just monitor your accounts and just fix it when you find something odd/wrong. The latter is the way to go

5 Factors to your credit score:

1. Payment History 35% (193 points)

   - To show up on your report it must be 30 calendar days late (29 is fine). This doesn't apply to the actual lender. If you are late there, they can change their terms/rates. Recency, Severity, and Frequency all factor in.
   - 30 calendar days will take 9 months to recover
   - 60 calendar days late takes 3 years to recover.
   - 90 calendar days late takes 7 years to recover. This one is especially bad for you.
   - Charge off - when the company has written it off as a loss - it might have gone to a collection agency. This is super bad. If you owe a collection agency - get a payment for delete written in writing.

2. Utilization Ratio / Indebtedness 30% (165 points)

   - Utilization Ratio: Non mortgage revolving lines of credt total (If coded correctly HELOC doesn't count, but bank might have not coded correctly so be careful) divided by the total of the limits of them. The number used is the balance on your monthly statement. So dont keep a high balance. This is the part of your credit score you have the biggest ability to affect.
   - < 30 Good
   - 30-50 Neutral
   - > 50 Bad
   - 0 Not Great (Important to realize that zero balance is bad). So use ALL your cards at least once a month.
   - Strategy: pay down your balance to 1% 3-4 days before your credit date.
   - Average Age of file (all your cards) matters a lot too. 3-5 years u get respect, 5-10 is good, 10+ great
   - Consistency of Cards makes a difference too. If you have a lot open, dont close them, if you dont have many open, dont keep opening new ones.

3. Age of File 15% (83 points)

   - Total Age of file
   - Average age of File

4. Mix of Credit 10% (55 points)

   - As many diff types of credit as possible. Suggestion is: 1 Mortgage, 2 Credit Cards, 2 Autmobiles, 1 Installment loan.

5. Inquries 10% (55 points)

   - Not important to credit report BUT important for approving of the loans
   - Soft Inquiry only appears to you, not to other lenders vs Hard Inquiry appears to others
   - The bank doesn't know if you got approved for a lot of credit recently, and if you were declined, the bank will wonder why you were declined - basically increases the banks risks
   - Inquiry Windows (If you go shopping for mortgages, auto, student they all count as 1, but credit cards are all counted separately)
   - 6 months - Banks will actively take a look at this
   - 1 year - How long they affect your credit score
   - 2 years - How long it stays on your report

Summary of General Rules for great credit:

1. Pay your bills on time, including CC
2. Use all your CC a tiny bit once a month, but keep your balances below 30%
3. Dont shut down old credit cards! (Or open too many new ones)
4. Try to keep different types of credit
5. Different Banks look at different Credit Reports which may be different depending on the algorithm that was used
6. Use a service to find out the best likelihood of approval. Will I be able to find out the best rate too?
7. Inquiries are little blocks of credit gold - dont use them up unneccessarily?
8. Check your scores to keep up to date: creditnerds.com (877)614.6373 checkmy3scores.com
9. 780 and 850 score is exactly the same (300-850)
10. Auto pay credit cards

### 1.3.3. Credit Card Interest, Billing Cylce and Grace periods

In your CC Billing cycle you have a month's worth of charges that you can make and your CC Balance will slowly rise with each charge. At the end of the month (This just represents one month, but a month can be from jan 15-Feb 14 for example, not necssarily the 1st to the 31st), you will get a "Statement" of all the charges you made that month. This is different from your "Balance" which is all charges added up that you currently owe, including charges made after your "Statement" was calculated. The amount in the "Statement" will be due within the "Grace Period" - usually 21-25 days. If you pay the full amount then, you are charged nothing.

HOWEVER!!! If you don't pay the full statement amount (even leave 1 dollar), then you will be charged interest on the balance you have been holding this second month (during the grace period), including any charges made within the grace period instantly and retroactively. Be careful of this - every charge is accruing interest PER DAY here. Use 4.5% APR(or whatever your APR is) / 365 days to get the daily interest charged.

### 1.3.4. Credit Audit/Repair/Upkeep

If you need credit repair, Eric Counts and his team does magic in this area. You just aren't knowledgable enough in this space. Dont try to dispute credit errors on your own online! This will make it harder for Eric and his team later. When in trouble call:

Creditnerds.com
$199 credit audit
$50 deletion fee per item
(average $1200-$1500)

## 1.4. Important Concepts, Terms, and Strategies

### 1.4.1. DTI (Debt to Income)

This is the first and biggest metric a lender looks at when deciding to lend you money. Its basically how much money you spend a month to cover your debts over how much you bring in.
This includes all things you are on the hook for - mortgage, car payments, loans, rent, etc. It does NOT include food, or variable living expenses.
It also takes your Gross Income (Not Net) Get your paychecks before taxes for the month. Things like rent will not be counted unless you can show income for 2 years (is this correct)

Debt/Income = DTI

Bank vs Actual DTI - Banks look at the DTI above, but for budgeting you really need to look at actual DTI taking into account living expenses and entertainment.

### 1.4.2. LTV Loan to Value ratio

This is the % the lender is giving u over the total value of the purchase. The lower the number for the lender, the better for them. Often this number can affect your interest rate.

### 1.4.3. Online Banking Savings Account Strategy

You can put your money in an online savings account and get 1.5-1.85% interest on your money. Be aware of minimum balances, maxiumum transactions per month, and transaction fees.

### 1.4.4. Keeping money in a Credit Union Savings

Another alternative is a Credit Union. 1% interest and less fees and hassle

### 1.4.5. Credit Card Introductory Rate strategy

Keep opening new Credit Cards for the sign up bonus, use it, then open another one with another sign up bonus. Biggest issue here is making sure that your credit score doesn't take a big hit, and managing the different accounts. You can net from 150-600 per new Credit Card open. Rinse and Repeat

### 1.4.6. APR (Annual percentage rate) vs APY (Annual percentage yield)

In APR, you just add the interest at the end of the year. For APY, you add each month's (could be day, quarter, etc) interest to that month before calculating the next month's interest. This is intra-year compounding.
Basically in APR, you only add the interest once a year - in APY, you add it for every period (quarterly, monthly, daily, etc)

APR = Periodic Rate x Number of periods in a year
APY = (1 + Periodic Rate)^Periods -1

Example: put $1000 in bank at 2% interest
Jan for APR and APY, you add $10000 _ 2% / 12 = $16.67
Feb for APR - same, BUT for APY, you take $10001.67 _ 2% / 12 = $16.70
And so on...

### 1.4.7. Velocity Banking Mortgage Payment Strategy

This is some really cool stuff. Here is a pic of a guide I wrote:

Good explanation here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWh5vBa-jhM

### 1.4.8. Stock Trading

I suggest using Robinhood, there are no transaction fees - make as many trades as you want at no cost to you.
