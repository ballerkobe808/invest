  Refinance Checklist
  List of things to consider/plan for when doing a refinance

==========================================

1) DTI
    Make sure that your DTI is valid with the new mortgage payment 
    (Find out if you can count Rent as part of your income - this is lender specific)


2) Cash Reserves
    Use the calculation sheet to verify that you have enough cash reserves
    Make sure the bank accounts where you keep the reserves are "clean" and also sourced w/ 2 bank statements


3) Credit Score
    Keep your Credit score high as possible 
    Debt Ratio is what you can control
    Try to avoid hard inquries (New CC or loan applications, new lines of credit, etc)


4) Appraisal
    Make a cover sheet/brochure to help the appraiser appraise as high as possible
    Also include comps to bring to the appraisers attention
    Submit a rebuttal if it comes in too low


5) Documents
   Make sure to have your documents organized for the lender
   Include a Personal Financial Statement for review
   Include a Business plan for the property


6) Lender(s) Research
   Find out Minimum Amount of loan (Often 50k)
   Find out how much of the rent can be counted
   Find out if they do portfolio loans as well?
   

7) (Optional) Existing Mortgage
    Make sure there is an existing mortgage on the property if you want to refinance faster
    The amount should be slightly higher than what you want to refinance for
    The payoff amount can come down to have the least out of pocket (and needed cash reserves to complete)
