# FINDING PROPERTIES

Always be on the lookout.
Keep learning and collecting data points - helps you to internalize value and recognize deals quickly.
Most important is finding the deal - deals are made WHEN BUYING!!

### How to find Value

Typical things to look for where u can get value:

1. The house needs upgrade/repair
2. It is in an area of town where people want to live (there will be demand to rent/buy later)
3. The owner is motivated to sell under market value

### Rental Portfolio

- Single/Multifamily Rentals with over 1.2% Rent to Value ratio.
- Be aware of too good to be true 2% RtV - often bad neighborhoods and not worth the headache - tip from experienced investors - also beware maint costs - same price for new HVAC in 50k and 100k house
- Solid Property Management - either in place or able to connect with some (So important! This is a make or break aspect - can make life terrible or awesome later)
- Great Locations!! This is very important. I want somewhere that people will want to rent, and that will be easy to manage. One eviction = thousands in damage, vacancy, legal fees, etc. Don't just look at spreadsheet numbers

Sort through agents, and find one that will be able to bring you good deals. Also look at it from his/her point of view too. What is he/she getting - will you be doing a lot of business, bringing business their way?Rewarding them with extra compensation or helping them out too? Be aware of what value u bring to the transaction.
