### Find the Owner

- ask neighbors who owner is - "I wanna buy this house and fix it up, but I can't find the owner"
- mail postcard to empty address (Return address requested) post office will send it back to you
- go to the courthouse and look up the property records - find the owner address

- Give them a list of options (with creative financing) and ask them which one works best for them - plan is to have them make a choice and also get a conversation going back and forth - maybe figure out more their needs

### Owners that would consider seller financing

1. Tired and burnt out
2. Lives out of state
3. Sick/personal circumstances
4. Avoid capital gains tax
5. Lare pre-payment penalty on loan
6. Has property management problems

### Negotiation Tips

Buy based on Numbers - Dont get emotionally attached!!
Be creative (Think out of the Box)
If you solve their problem, they will sell you their property

- Find the sellers motivation
- Ask why he/she is selling multiple time/multiple ways
- be positive and friendly
- call it a property not a "home" take the emotions out of it
- listen more talk less
- (find things in common, to bond over)

4 negotiate the contract

Great negotiators get what they want, without asking for it, and the other person thinks they won
Dont bid first! - let them bring a number to the table first (whats your lowest offer?)
Do it over the phone - its faster (use body languaage still - shake your head no - it sounds negative)
They give a price - you stay silent for 5 sec
"hi this is Daniel, I found your house at Main st. If I can pay cash and close quickly, what is the least amount you would be willing to take?"
Wait 5 sec "Is that the best you can do?"
Wait 5 sec "So, if I cant do \$80,000, we can't do business?"
Practice this so it comes off natural

### Reasons for a seller to do lease option

Lease option from an owner

No maint- take care of it like its my own i wanna buy it
Agreed upon price w no realtor/commision fees
When selling dont have to worry about me asking fix this or that. Im happy ive been living here and taking care of it like its my own
