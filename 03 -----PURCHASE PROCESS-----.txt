 PROCESS - Purchase and Closing on the property
===============================================================
NOTE: Save all documentation with everything you do in an organized way! This will make life easier in the future.

1. Submit Bid and reach an Negotiate with Seller - Get it under Contract!!!

   EMD (Earnest Money Down - send to the Title Company)

   Work with a real estate agent. Usually better to use a realtor vs trying to save the seller money. 
   Safer for you, and good deals usually aren't dependent on the seller getting the absolute lowest price.
   Important!

   Things to add to the purchase agreement:

   1. Subject to Home Inspection
   2. Subject to Lender Terms (Note: dont put too many subject tos and scare the seller away)
   3. Seller to cover 2% of closing costs. (2% is max for inv property, 6% for FHA)
   4. Ernest money to hold the property usually
   5. Always add: Daniel, and/or assigns (you should always add this cuz it wont hurt, but can help) Different 
      states may use diff verbage

2. Home Inspection
   Get an inspection - important to know what you are getting - about $300-$600.

3. Lender Appraisal
   Lender will require this to loan you money - usually you pay for this. $300-500. If it comes back lower 
   than expected, you will have to cover the diff or ask the seller to drop the price.

4. Connect with the property manager -
   Get a property manager lined up, interviewed and ready to go when its time. Leases, terms, and a feel for 
   the company are important here.
   - Get a estoppel from tenants - basically a statement saying what their lease is - how much they pay and term


5. Close.
   About 60-75 days from the time you sign the purchase agreement to the time you sign the closing documents. 
   (up to 90 days) Communicate in a timely manner with everyone!



Contracts to Buy 
----------------------------
PURCHASE & SALE AGREEMENT FOR REAL ESTATE -
Certain states have ammendments that need to be added
Realtors want their contract involved - but its better to use yours - make sure the realtors know they will 
get their full commission
Draw a line over their contract, initial, and write "See Addendum"

NOTES:

1. Add "And/Or Assigns" to your buyer name (Just in case you might need it)
2. EXACT LEGAL DESCRIPTION TO FOLLOW - Add in all the things that will be included with the property, line by 
   line - refrigerator, stove, dishwasher, washer, dryer, all curtain hardware, HVAC, ceiling fans, 
   light fixtures, etc. Add some extra things (like 50 in flat screen TV, mower, etc) so you have room to barter. 
   Make sure the house isn't stripped clean when they leave. Putting things in here could save you a lot of 
   headaches of things that need to be replaced later. These can be in an addendum. Include the appliances model 
   and serial number of everything (appliances) Take video to validate what was there.
3. Get HOA Bylaws in order to know what is required - some will make you want to walk
4. Keep Ernest Deposits Small and held by a third party - never give to the homeowner
5. Don't leave blank space on contract and get copies of everything you sign
6. Read every word of the contract
