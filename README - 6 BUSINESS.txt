BUSINESS
======================


Structures of for-profit businesses
----------------------------------
Each state will be slightly different

1. Sole Proprietership
   Simple to setup and dissolve, and cheapest. However, unlimited liability, and profits are reported on 
   your personal tax return. Valid for 5 years.

2. Partnerships
   2 ore more people agree to share business. Each parter contributes and shares the profits and losses on 
   their ind tax returns. General - At least one partner has unlimited liability. Limited - limits to 
   personal liability of each partner

3. Corporation (C & S).
   Everyone says to go with an S - dont even consider a C for our purposes.

4. LLC
   attributes of a corporation and tax status of a partnership






Creating an LLC
---------------------------
Create an LLC in the state you are buying the property in.
This helps when you need to evict or be a "business" in that state. Also, you will only be taxed in that 
state vs being registered as a foreign entity in that state, and get taxed there as well as in your home LLC state.

Incorporate in Nevada (great privacy laws) or Wyoming??


LLC Documents
-----------------------
1. Articles of Incorporation
2. Minutes


Starting up your Business
----------------------------------
Start tracking all your expenses before u open your business. These are considered start up costs and can be 
written off. Your business is not legally open until your first sale.

You need a business address and registered agent address. If you dont want to use your own, you can use 
Mark Kohlers law firm to forward you mail - 150 for the business address and 125 for the registered agent 
address annually


Keep good records
----------------------------------
Keep an organized tracking of everything you do - start in excel, then move into quickbooks eventually. 
Suggest to use Mark Kohler and his firm in the future.
I found that excel is quicker and more powerful for me - i can run reports I need and update faster than 
waiting for the app to respond in the cloud - or be restricted by the way accounting works

Kohlers 5 keys to maintain ur entity
----------------------------------
1. Setup checking account
2. Own your property
3. Tell the world (URL, bus headers, email, contact info etc)
4. Contractral Requirements - have all contracts point to your entity and not you
5. Maintain the entity (Have minutes, board meetings, etc)

Don't Co-mingle
--------------------
Keep everything separate - If you decide to form an LLC, you need to take certain steps to ensure 
everything to do with your company is completely separate from any of your personal affairs.

This means separate bank accounts, credit cards, email addresses, etc. If you co-mingle the two, 
you run the risk of losing whatever protection you may have under your LLC because a Judge could 
rule that that the LLC is too close to your personal assets and therefore, not a separate entity.








Land Trust Strategy
----------------------------------
Create a land trust and make your LLC the beneficiary
Then deed the property over to your Land Trust...

There are two types of transfers that can potentially raise an alarm about the due on sale clause: (1) 
the transfer to an LLC and (2) the transfer to a trust. A transfer to an LLC will trigger the clause and 
should therefore be avoided even though banks are hesitant to ever foreclose as long as the note is being 
paid. Even with the note being paid, the banks will still send threatening letters. This issue can be 
avoided completely by transferring the property into a land trust.

While a transfer to an LLC will cause alarms at the bank and prompt them to send you a letter, a transfer 
to a trust will not. A transfer to a trust is exempt from due on sale violations since banks will view 
transfers to a trust as an estate planning tool. You should not even receive a letter from the bank.

This is part of the reason I recommend people consider transferring properties into a Land Trust prior 
to moving the properties into the LLC, or Series LLC. The Land Trust is also a private document, 
so you can also keep your name from public record if you create it the correct way.





Alternative strategy to forming an LLC for asset protection (Umbrella Policy)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Many Investors who don’t want to manage properties under an LLC opt for extra liability insurance
This is often referred to as an “umbrella policy” and it basically gives you protection beyond your average 
rental dwelling policy. These policies are typically pretty affordable as well.
Beefing up your liability insurance can be a good option if you feel you need more coverage but don’t want 
to go the LLC route.
Remember, no plan, whether it be an LLC or Insurance, is a 100% guarantee of protection.

More thoughts on this:

LLCs are only needed if you have Lots and Lots and Lots of equity, hundreds of thousands of dollars worth. 
And if you have that, you are smart enough to do what your attorney tells you to do for asset protection.

LLCs are only useful if you get sued. Most people are never sued.

LLCs are only useful in a lawsuit if the LLC was properly formed in the first place. LLCs are only useful 
if the Operating Agreement was followed. LLCs are only useful if you never co-mingle funds. LLCs are only 
useful if minutes were taken. LLCs are only useful if ALL required actions concerning the LLC were followed 
to the point of proving to the judge, in court, that the LLC is truly a separate entity and was treated as 
such. Probably .000000175% of people actually follow all of the details of an LLC. (I made up the statistic, 
but I know from talking to a lot of investors, they don't have a clue how an LLC is supposed to run because 
they simply down loaded a form to create the LLC and were off and running. Oh, well.) Fortunately for most, 
they will never have to find out in court that they did things all wrong. Besides, 95% of law suits are 
settled before going to rial (I didn't make that one up.) Having the LLC plays little to no role in coming 
to a settlement before a trial.

Attorneys don't look to see if you have an LLC, they look to see if you have assets. If they can't get paid, 
they won't take the case. Besides, there are some legal and clever ways around the LLC that a good 
experienced trial attorney would already know. I'm not going to mention them here, I don't want to give 
any attorneys any ideas. ;-)

You are more protected buying umbrella insurance and it is a heck of a lot more convenient. IMHO




Next Level Asset Protection Strategies
----------------------------------
Use an LLC to protect yourself and other assets from lawsuits from within your LLC
Using your 401k to own your LLCs is super safe - OJ Simpson did this.
Have an anonymous trust as the owner of your LLC for another level
If its too complex, lawyers will lose interest and it wont be worth their time.


Wyoming, Delare, Nevada LLCs
-------------------------------
LLCs in these states have privacy, so the manager (you) doesn't show up in public records

If you use ANDERSON FINANCIAL - They will be your Managing member in your Wyoming LLC, and they
have offices there to answer phone calls, or forward your mail, etc. So its legit and you dont
have to worry about someone "piercing the veil"

Pro tip: If you own a property free and clear, put a lien on it so others cant see you own it free and clear
For attorneys who get paid on contigencies this won't make it attractive to pursue

File Biennial Reports with the SOS 
- In order to keep your LLC in good standing, you must file 
a report every other year following the year it was formed and it must be done within its anniversary month.

The purpose of this report is to keep your business records up to date with the state which allows the 
government, creditors, and other interested parties to look up your business information should they 
need to contact you.

They can be filed online and cost \$50 per report. If you fail to complete these reports, it could result 
in the company being dissolved.
