14 Day Rule 
-----------------------------------------------
The 14-day rule—sometimes called the "Masters exception" because of its popularity in Georgia 
during the annual Masters golf tournament—is the most important for anyone considering renting out a 
vacation home. Under this rule, you don't pay tax on income you earn from the short-term rental, as long as you:

Rent the property for no more than 14 days during the year 
AND
Use the vacation house yourself 14 days or more during the year or 
at least 10% of the total days you rent it to others.

Be aware that you cannot deduct any expenses for those 14 nights.  
(Dont report any income at all if you are going to use this rule)


Passive vs Active Income (Schedule E Vs. Schedule C)
-----------------------------------------------------------
ACTIVE income implies you materially participated in the production of your income. (Will pay self employement tax)
PASSIVE income implies you didn’t materially participate in the production of your income.


Using Schedule E
Landlords should use Schedule E if they rent rooms, apartments or entire buildings and provide 
only “basic services” to their tenants. Basic services include things such as utilities, trash collection, 
A/C, repairs, maintenance, Internet/Wifi, cleaning common areas, water & gas.
On Schedule E, you report your rental income as well as your expenses associated with that income. 
You can report up to three separate properties on each Schedule E, and file as many copies of the 
schedule as you need to report all properties.

Using Schedule C
Landlords report rental income on Schedule C — “Profit or Loss From Business” — if they provide more 
than basic services to tenants. Housekeeping, linen service, maid service, and meals are examples of 
substantial services that would require a landlord to use Schedule C.
In essence, once you start providing substantial services, you’re not just renting property; 
you’re running a hotel or boarding house. Those count as businesses — thus the requirement for Schedule C. 
You must also use Schedule C if they rent the property as part of their business as a real estate dealer.



State GET and TAT
-----------------------
Sign up for a Tax ID in Hawaii (I'm signed up as an LLC)
My Tax ID: GE-211-076-8128-01

Pay GET (4.5%) and TAT (10.25%) 

Depending how much you will pay in taxes you will pay more/less often
< $2000 in taxes = semi- annually
< $4000 in taxes = quarterly
> $4000 in taxes = monthly

For me, I will file/pay taxes using the G-45 quarterly: (Apr 1, July 1, Oct, 1, Jan 1)

G-49 --- I will also need to file the G-49 at the end of the year.
Due to several reasons, the numbers on your G45 Periodic GE Tax Returns will not always match the gross 
receipts number as filed on your income tax returns. This could happen because perhaps you gave some 
refunds or maybe your bookkeeping didn’t match form 1099s that you received.
It is required to use form G49 to reconcile the differences, and this is even if there are no changes.
Form G49 is designed to give you credit for all of the taxes you paid, so if your gross income number 
is smaller than as expected, you may even get a refund. But if you made more in gross receipts than what 
you reported all year, then you might owe some more GE Tax.

Taxes are due 20 days after the quarter (Apr 20).
