### Team members

Here are the key members:

1. Your Mentor(s)/Coach – A trusted, experienced adviser. Most successful
   businesspeople have learned invaluable lessons through training from
   mentors.

2. Real Estate Agent – A person who represents buyers or sellers of
   properties and land, for a commission. Good agents know their market,
   can bring deals to you, and have marketing reach.

3. Mortgage Broker – A liaison between loan applicants and lenders.
   Brokers can find the best loans for buyers at the best rates, since they
   work with various lenders. Investors can use mortgage brokers to assess
   the financial viability of making an offer on the property, as well as to
   generate leads.

4. Real Estate Attorney – Assists with purchase agreements, titles, and
   complicated transactions. Important for contracts and understanding
   the applicable laws in every step of the process.

5. Contractor – Person or company that performs and oversees the
   construction of the property. A good general contractor is priceless to
   your flipping business. You want one who is dependable, finishes on
   time, and works within the budget.

6. Escrow Agent or Title Rep – A neutral third party who holds funds and
   documents in a real estate transfer. Essential for closing deals quickly;
   find one who will have your back.

7. Accountant – A person responsible for inspecting or keeping
   financial accounts. Be sure to hire a Certified Public Accountant who
   specializes in or is very knowledgeable of real estate. Important for
   tax write-offs.

8. Insurance Agent – A person who sells insurance policies. It’s important
   to understand what kinds of accidents or disasters could happen to
   the property and get insurance coverage through a knowledgeable
   source to cover your potential liability.

9. Supportive Family & Friends – A network of people who care about
   you and your best interests. This is always important, no matter
   what you do.

   OPTIONAL TEAM MEMBERS:

10. Appraiser – Determines the value of property or land. Useful for
    providing current, market-based price estimates before listing real
    estate for sale.

11. Home Inspector – Examines the condition of the home to ascertain
    what repairs will be needed and identifies maintenance, fire, and
    safety issues, as well as building code violations, etc. Investors can
    use a home inspector’s observations to determine the extent and cost
    of renovations and determine whether they want to purchase the
    property.

12. Property Manager – Oversees the operations, landscaping, and
    maintenance of a property and handles terms with tenants, such as
    collecting rent and filing for evictions. If you don’t want to or can’t
    deal directly with the maintenance and rental of a property, it’s great
    to have someone do it for you.

13. Handyman – A person who can do household repairs and minor
    renovations. A capable handyman is great for dealing with small
    building issues in a rental property

14. Virtual assistants – Provide administrative assistance from a home
    office. They help you follow up on leads, phone calls, and emails and
    manage administrative tasks. They are usually self-employed, which
    saves you money on taxes and health benefits.

15. Automated systems – Websites, filters, call forwarding, automated
    email replies, and other such systems that reduce the need for
    human involvement. These systems lower your costs and streamline
    communications.
    Be careful about overdoing the size of the team. The more people you
    have, the more coordinating you have to do. It takes time to put together
    a good team. However, don’t think that you have to have every member
    of your team in place before you can get started. You can add and subtract
    members of the team on an as-needed basis.
