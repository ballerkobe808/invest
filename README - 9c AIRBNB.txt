AIRBNB

ws are full of exceptions, but the 14-day rule—sometimes called the "Masters exception" because of its popularity in Georgia during the annual Masters golf tournament—is the most important for anyone considering renting out a vacation home. Under this rule, you don't pay tax on income you earn from the short-term rental, as long as you:

Rent the property for no more than 14 days during the year AND
Use the vacation house yourself 14 days or more during the year or at least 10% of the total days you rent it to others.
Portland resident Alice Chan earns extra income by renting out her vacation home on the Oregon Coast several times a year. These days, she is careful to keep the total rental time under 14 days—a tactic she recommends to others.


Be aware that you cannot deduct any expenses for those 14 nights.
