Questions to Ask Property Management Companies

1. Can you tell me more about your property management company?
   (How much experience do they have?) How do you handle problems - how big are you? Processes in place..? 
   How long have you been in business? How big is your company - amount of people and roles? 
   Do you have electronic and automated systems set up? Direct Deposit?

2. What are the fees?
   Setup fee - say \$300 to open account - Monthly 8%-12%? Is this on rent Collected, or rent due, 
   rent scheduled, rent value, etc. It should be on rent collected to assure not paying when there is no rent. 
   Vacancy Fee? Listing/new tenant fee? Lease renewal fee? Is there evection insurance? 
   What do you charge for evictions? How are they handled? Any other fees?
   What about late fees? How much and who gets them - owner or prop management company.

3. How many properties are you managing? Do you manage both short-term and long-term rentals?
   These days, many property managers are involved with managing short-term rentals through sites 
   like Airbnb and VRBO. Short-term rentals are a different business and can take up a lot of a 
   property manager’s time. Make sure they have the time to focus on your long-term rentals.

4. Whats your typical process to advertise and fill the properties?
   How long does it take you to turn a property around in between tenants? Can you do it in 24 hours or 
   does the owner have to lose weeks to a month of rent every time a tenant change occurs? Tenant screening 
   - Criminal and background checks? Take photos before and after tenant moves in and out
   How do you determine rent amount?

5. How do you handle tenant calls for repairs?
   How do you handle maintenance and yard work?
   What is your philosophy on repairs and replacement?
   Do you try to solve the problem before sending out a repair person?
   Who do you use for repairs? Electrical, plumbing, appliances?
   Do they have a handy man that they try to use for most repairs or do they use outside vendors? 
   If they have a skilled handy man you may get quality work for less.
   How do you handle yard work? Is your property manager up to the task or is it something tenants should handle?

6. Do you conduct routine property inspections?
   Property inspections help you catch problems and conduct maintenance before it’s too late. 
   Whether it’s checking on how tenants are treating your spaces or ensuring that appliances and 
   utilities are functioning correctly, spaces need to be kept in the best shape possible to 
   prevent costly renovations and assure that the space isn’t being misused in any way.

7. What rental management tool do you use?
   Rental management software is helpful for streamlining management processes and increasing profits, 
   making it an excellent tool for any professional property manager.

8. Do you have any rental properties of your own?
   While it may seem beneficial for a property manager to have their own rental properties, 
   according to Peter Giardini, this is actually a bad idea.
