### Team Strategy
==============================

"The richest people in the world look for and build networks;
everyone else looks for work."

Talk to as many people as possible about your real estate goals
I want people to "like" me - walk away from a conversation saying "that guy is cool", "I want to help him"
Add as much value as you can into other peoples lives. 
Build a positive reputation. 
Remember you represent Jesus!!

1. Build your team

   == Inner Circle ==
   - mentors/peers 
   - more exp and success than you and willing to help/guide you 
   - board of directors or millionaire masterminds 
   - will help or connect u, could be support circle too - touch them once a month

   == Support Circle ==
   - professional team 
   - advice and management 
   - details of what you need and will help find people you will contact 
   - transaction advisors and managers 
   - have ability to manage the diff pieces (real estate agent, etc) touch them on every transaction

   == Service Circle ==
   - independent contractors 
   - inspectors, electricians, painters 
   - limited scope 
   - personally direct or support team will direct

2. Building Relationships

   - Call them once a month - 2 calls a day will touch everyone in your network
   - Mail them something interesting every month
   - See them every month in person
   - Review your net worth worksheet with someone - and ask them to keep you accountable
   - Ask yourself - who am i calling today, who am I seeing this week, who am I mailing this month?
   - Two questions to ask someone:
     1. Who do you know that I should know?
     2. What would you do if you were me?

3. Build a reputation

   - Do deals - you need to be involved - make offers, take deals, etc
   - Keep your word - do what you promise, and show up on time
   - Dont talk bad about anyone - nobody trusts a gossip
   - Dont short change anyone - time or money
   - Refer business to your network - help people make connections

4. Reading/Listening to Books and Watching Videos

   - Keep growing and learning!!

14. Virtual assistants – Provide administrative assistance from a home

    saves you money on taxes and health benefits.

15. Automated systems – Websites, filters, call forwarding, automated
    email replies, and other such systems that reduce the need for
    human involvement. These systems lower your costs and streamline
    communications.

    Be careful about overdoing the size of the team. The more people you
    have, the more coordinating you have to do. It takes time to put together
    a good team. However, don’t think that you have to have every member
    of your team in place before you can get started. You can add and subtract
    members of the team on an as-needed basis.
