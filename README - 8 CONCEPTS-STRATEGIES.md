Use your heloc to make the money in your property accessible

## Acronyms

### 1.4.1. DTI (Debt to Income)

This is the first and biggest metric a lender looks at when deciding to lend you money. Its basically how much money you spend a month to cover your debts over how much you bring in.
This includes all things you are on the hook for - mortgage, car payments, loans, rent, etc. It does NOT include food, or variable living expenses.
It also takes your Gross Income (Not Net) Get your paychecks before taxes for the month. Things like rent will not be counted unless you can show income for 2 years (is this correct)

Debt/Income = DTI

Bank vs Actual DTI - Banks look at the DTI above, but for budgeting you really need to look at actual DTI taking into account living expenses and entertainment.

### 1.4.2. LTV Loan to Value ratio

This is the % the lender is giving u over the total value of the purchase. The lower the number for the lender, the better for them. Often this number can affect your interest rate.

### 1.4.3. Online Banking Savings Account Strategy

You can put your money in an online savings account and get 1.5-1.85% interest on your money. Be aware of minimum balances, maxiumum transactions per month, and transaction fees.

### 1.4.4. Keeping money in a Credit Union Savings

Another alternative is a Credit Union. 1% interest and less fees and hassle

### 1.4.5. Credit Card Introductory Rate strategy

Keep opening new Credit Cards for the sign up bonus, use it, then open another one with another sign up bonus. Biggest issue here is making sure that your credit score doesn't take a big hit, and managing the different accounts. You can net from 150-600 per new Credit Card open. Rinse and Repeat

### 1.4.6. APR (Annual percentage rate) vs APY (Annual percentage yield)

In APR, you just add the interest at the end of the year. For APY, you add each month's (could be day, quarter, etc) interest to that month before calculating the next month's interest. This is intra-year compounding.
Basically in APR, you only add the interest once a year - in APY, you add it for every period (quarterly, monthly, daily, etc)

APR = Periodic Rate x Number of periods in a year
APY = (1 + Periodic Rate)^Periods -1

Example: put $1000 in bank at 2% interest
Jan for APR and APY, you add$10000 _ 2% / 12 = $16.67
Feb for APR - same, BUT for APY, you take$10001.67 _ 2% / 12 = \$16.70
And so on...

### ARM Adjustable Rate Mortgage

5, 7, 9 year ARMs usually. The opposite is fixed rate. Dangerous if the rates are gonna go up later

### Lease with an option strategy to buy

3 Options that will tenant will choose at the end

1. choose not to buy
2. choose to buy and use a bank
3. choose to buy and use you as the bank

The target tenant will be someone with 2300-4400 set aside for housing, that are looking to get their life back on track.
You kinda want a home that a family will live in, so at least 3/2 in hawaii, also safe neighborhoods

4 Types of Income from Lease Option

Structuring the deal (Contract)

### Refinancing

If you are looking to take cash out with a conventional loan in the first 6 months of ownership then you will have to meet the delayed financing guidelines. Main takeaways from delayed financing are

- the value of the property will be capped at the purchase price even if the home appraised higher.

- you will have to prove source of funds for the purchase

- if you opened any new unsecured debt when purchasing the home then that debt must be paid off when cashing out.

If you wait 6 months then these requirements are waived
