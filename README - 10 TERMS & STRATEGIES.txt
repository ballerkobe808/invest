Important Concepts, Terms, and Strategies
===================================================

TERMS
================

ARV - After Repair Value - The estimated or actual value of a house after rehabbing/repairing it

NOI - Net Operating Income - The amount of money a property makes every month not taking into account mortgage, 
  or capital exp

COC - Cash on Cash return - How much cash you get back annually vs how much cash you personally put in

ROI - Return on Investment - Yearly Net Return over your cash investment

ROE - Return on Equity - Yearly Net Return over the equity you have in the property (this will decrease as 
  you pay off the mortgage)

Cap Rate - NOI divided by the purchase price

PMI - Private Mortgage Insurace - If you put down less than 20% on a house, then you gotta buy insurace for 
  the remainder in case u cant pay or you default later on...

DTI (Debt to Income)
  This is the first and biggest metric a lender looks at when deciding to lend you money. Its basically how much 
  money you spend a month to cover your debts over how much you bring in.
  This includes all things you are on the hook for - mortgage, car payments, loans, rent, etc. It does NOT 
  include food, or variable living expenses.
  It also takes your Gross Income (Not Net) Get your paychecks before taxes for the month. Things like 
  rent will not be counted unless you can show income for 2 years (is this correct)

  Debt/Income = DTI

  Bank vs Actual DTI - Banks look at the DTI above, but for budgeting you really need to look at actual 
  DTI taking into account living expenses and entertainment.

LTV - Loan to Value ratio
  This is the % the lender is giving u over the total value of the purchase. The lower the number for the lender, 
  the better for them. Often this number can affect your interest rate.


APR (Annual percentage rate) vs APY (Annual percentage yield)
  In APR, you just add the interest at the end of the year. For APY, you add each month's (could be day, 
  quarter, etc) interest to that month before calculating the next month's interest. This is intra-year compounding.
  Basically in APR, you only add the interest once a year - in APY, you add it for every period (quarterly, 
  monthly, daily, etc)

  APR = Periodic Rate x Number of periods in a year
  APY = (1 + Periodic Rate)^Periods -1

  Example: put $1000 in bank at 2% interest
  Jan for APR and APY, you add$10000 _ 2% / 12 = $16.67
  Feb for APR - same, BUT for APY, you take$10001.67 _ 2% / 12 = \$16.70
  And so on...

ARM Adjustable Rate Mortgage
  5, 7, 9 year ARMs usually. The opposite is fixed rate. Dangerous if the rates are gonna go up later

BPO - brokers price opinion

FMV - fair market value

FICO 08 - specific credit score bank uses (you have 9 diff credit scores)

CMA - comparable market analysis


NPV - net present value - the value of a future amount of money (given an interest rate you are paying for the money)
for example. if you are borrowing money at 10%, then getting back 30% of your money in a year is worth more than getting
back 30% of your money 4 years from now. npv calculates the value of 30% in a year or 30% in 4 years, while
paying 10% in interest yearly. 

IRR - internal rate of return - the annual (or whatever timeframe) rate of return taking into account the npv of the return


Strategies
======================================

Online Banking Savings Account Strategy
  You can put your money in an online savings account and get 1.5-1.85% interest on your money. Be aware of 
  minimum balances, maxiumum transactions per month, and transaction fees.

Keeping money in a Credit Union Savings
  Another alternative is a Credit Union. 1% interest and less fees and hassle

Credit Card Introductory Rate strategy
  Keep opening new Credit Cards for the sign up bonus, use it, then open another one with another sign up bonus. 
  Biggest issue here is making sure that your credit score doesn't take a big hit, and managing the different 
  accounts. You can net from 150-600 per new Credit Card open. Rinse and Repeat
