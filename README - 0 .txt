Equity Sharing

Master Lease
-Rent the building in order to sublease

Option
-right but not an obligation

put (record) a memorandum on the title so owner cant sell it

questions -
why are you selling
is there a mortgage on the house? Can i take that over???
If i were to give you the money, what would you do with it?

give them a list of choices

agreement for deed (if seller has a mortgage)
put a memorandum on the title (not the agreement itself so future buyers dont see how much you paid for the property)
seller carryback mortgage (if seller owns it outright)
terms after so many years i get the property
make sure to write the depreciation into the contract - we deserve it more

subject to (take over the sellers mortgage)
taking ownership of the property (deed/title), but leaving the mortgage in the sellers name
Beware of bank calling mortgage (due on sale clause) (highly unlikely but possible)

-Authorization to release information - allows you to talk to the lender and get information about how much is owed on the loan. Also talk to any other creditors and talk to them on your sellers behalf
-Seller Disclore - Seller warrants there is no bankruptcy or planned bankruptcy on the house
-Limited Power of Attorney - Allows documents on sellers behalf related to the property (tax, mortgage, etc)
-CYS Letter - Cover your self letter - Seller understands loan will be staying in their name. we are not liable if loan is called due, etc
