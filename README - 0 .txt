General Investment Strategy and Processes
=================================================


PROCESSES - As much as possible build processes to free up mental space.

Research more List
----------------------------
1. Set your goals and find your why

Its gonna be hard. When things are not going right, you need to find that spark or reason to 
keep perservering and pushing through. Remember your WHY!!

Freedom to spend more time with wife and family.
Freedom from worrying about money.
Freedom from being forced to work hard in a job with no end.
Ability to help others around me.



Creative Aquisitions
---------------------------
Equity Sharing

Master Lease
- Rent the building in order to sublease

Option
- Its a right but not an obligation
- If you buy an option, put (record) a memorandum on the title so owner cant sell it



Agreement for Deed (if seller has a mortgage)
put a memorandum on the title (not the agreement itself so future buyers dont see how much you 
paid for the property)
seller carryback mortgage (if seller owns it outright)
terms after so many years i get the property
make sure to write the depreciation into the contract - we deserve it more

Subject To (take over the sellers mortgage)
taking ownership of the property (deed/title), but leaving the mortgage in the sellers name
Beware of bank calling mortgage (due on sale clause) (highly unlikely but possible)
Documents that help you

-Authorization to release information - allows you to talk to the lender and get information about 
how much is owed on the loan. Also talk to any other creditors and talk to them on your sellers behalf
-Seller Disclore - Seller warrants there is no bankruptcy or planned bankruptcy on the house
-Limited Power of Attorney - Allows documents on sellers behalf related to the property (tax, mortgage, etc)
-CYS Letter - Cover your self letter - Seller understands loan will be staying in their name. we are not 
liable if loan is called due, etc


Questions for seller:
============================
1. why are you selling
2. is there a mortgage on the house? Can i take that over???
3. If i were to give you the money, what would you do with it?

- give them a list of choices
