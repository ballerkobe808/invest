Questions to clearly answer private lenders
============================================
Q: How and when will I get my money back?
A: Have a clear and concise path to return of their capital
Clearly outline and be prepared to go into more detail

Q: What are the risks?
A: Don't soften or pull any punches - tell them there are risks associated
with investing. The rental market could crash, tenant stops paying rent, 
the flip wont sell, or appraise high enough.
Tell them what you are doing to mitigate those risks - Show your
conservative numbers in appraisal and, you have vacancy in your rental
projections. 

Q: How much of your own money are you putting in?
A: If you are putting your own money in, bring this up early - it helps a lot
people like to see you put your money where your mouth is
Show them the amount of work you are doing to keep the deal moving -
sweat equity

Q: What if I need my money back?
A: Educate them - its not liquid, hard to get cash back quickly - 
Dont put in cash that you will need for something else real soon. It
takes time, and doesn't always go exactly as planned

Q: How doe this affect my income taxes?
A: If they haven't invested before, you will need to explain money they make
with you is taxable. They will be getting a 1099 from me or interest on 
the loans. Best to consult with a CPA - this will help explain the process to them.

Q: What are the logistics?
A: How do they get their money to you, how is it protected, legal documents to
set things up. If its an IRA hold their hand thru it to get the money to an
IRA custodian. You will have to teach them. Explain mortgages and lien if they
haven't loaned before. Explain an operating agreement if its an equity deal and
how it protects them. Make sure they are clear how it all works.
Don't be afraid to tell them you need to get more information before you give
them an answer.

Questions to consider when determining Loan Terms
===========================================================
1. Who is lending you the money and where is it coming from?
It could be an LLC, their SDIRA, etc

2. What is the deal?
Type of deal determines type of loan needed

3. How quickly to do I need to close? 
How soon do I need the cash??

4. How much construction is involved?
Be careful of ballooning construction costs and timeframes
Possibly break down purchase and construction draws - this way
money is not all up front and you are not paying interest on the total balance
Possibly no interest or half interest on money for construction in escrow


Pitfalls to avoid
===============================
1. Loan origination points and fees for renewal
Read loan documents carefully - esp what-ifs of loan going over time. 
Possible to go into auto default if you go over the alloted timeframe.
Give yourself LOTS of extra room.

2. Monthly payments on fix and flips
You dont make any income during the fixing - this could be really 
deterimental for you.
Sometimes you gotta do this to make the deal work tho.

3. Prepayment penalties and Guaranteed Minimums

4. Closing without ALL the money needed to complete the deal
You can be tempted to close on the deal cuz it has to be done fast. Just leads
to a lot of problems

Documents
===================
1. Promisary Note
"I owe you" note, including terms - interest rate, points, loan maturity date, etc
Ask the borrow to mail it to you with a "Paid in Full" on the bottom and signed

2. Mortgage Security document (aka Deed of Trust)
Lien on the property - property owner cant sell or refinance, lender can begin
a foreclusure proceeding if the loan goes into default as defined in the loan terms
of the promissary note. 

3. Additional Collateral - Personal Guarantee
Borrowers personal assets - cash, personal property are additional collateral

4. Additional Collateral - Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure
Lender must foreclose on a Lien, but in this one, he gets the property outright


Closing date and Loan payoff date
-----------------------------------
Give lender 2 weeks notice so they have the money ready
Can send the money to the title company in advance
Make sure lender gets a copy of EVERYTHING (closing statement, promisary note, mortgage doc, and all others)

Payoff date, keep lender in the loop
Need Payoff letter, stating how much you owe
Remove the mortage - either original mortgage doc or discharge of mortgage doc

Justin - Options to lend
===============================

Option 1. 
------------------
300k @ 7%

Monthly Cashflow = $1,750 Guaranteed

Pros:
  - Guaranteed 
  - Get a check no matter if I'm using the money or not
  - Keep 300k capital at the end of the term + interest gained
  - Can pull money out any time (As long as its not currently in a Deal - typical timeframe 2-6 months)

Cons:
  - No property owned at the end of the term


Option 2.
-------------------------------------
Buy 2 properties, I will manage, Lend the rest at 7%

4440 Evanston - 90k (10k equity) (Rent $1135)
4530 Ralston - 140k (Rent $1000 - Bump to $1100 next year)

Cashflow = 2135 - 230(110, 120) PM - 105(40, 67) Ins - 130(120, 110) Prop Tax
Monthly Cashflow = $1670 (Could be less if expenses - turnovers,repairs, etc)

80k @ 7%

Monthly Cashflow = $467 Guaranteed

Total Monthly Cashflow = $2137

Pros:
  - Highest potential cashflow
  - Keep 70k capital afer term + interest gained
  - Own 2 cashflowing houses, and will get appreciation over time
  - I will manage the rental for you

Notes: It will have to be 2 years before you can take Title officially in a 1031 Exchange. Preferably, I'd like to
keep title longer since I have the mortgages borrowed against the properties at a really cheap rate. The actual 
status will be you have the option to purchase the properties at the agreed upon price at the end of some
term, and in the mean time you will be getting all the rent from the properties, in exchange for letting me
borrow the funds for the purchase



Option 3. 
------------------------------------------
Partner on future Deals:

300k @ 2% 

Monthly Cashflow = $500 Guaranteed

I will be buying properties, rehabbing, them, and then refinancing. 
From this point on, any properties purchased, we would do a "Draft" later and pick which properties we
want to keep. You would pay for whatever equity is in the property at the time, but gain a cashflowing asset.

Example:
Purchase for 70k
Rehab for 25k
Appraise for 110k
Refinance 25%, means 30k of equity
Renting at 1000/month will cashflow around $250/month (minus expenses)
Option to purchase this asset for 30k at the end of the term
