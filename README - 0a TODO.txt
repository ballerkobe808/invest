----------------------------
My WHY
----------------------------
Review this regularly!!

Its gonna be hard. When things are not going right, you need to find that spark or reason to 
keep perservering and pushing through. Remember your WHY!!

Freedom to spend more time with wife and family.
Freedom from worrying about money.
Freedom from being forced to work hard in a job with no end.
Ability to help others around me.

Pain vs Pleasure
-------------------------------
Avoiding Pain/Fear is a FAR better motivator than Pleasure.
Its the pain or fear of being poor that will push you that extra mile a lot more than the 
potential pleasure for a great life 

When you are tired or uncomfortable its PAIN, or the fear and/or memory of 
PAIN that will drive you. 
Latch onto this - use it to your advantage!!

When you get stuck, lazy, or fearful, think of all the things you will lose by not taking action.
Really think deeply about it until you start to feel the pain that will occur by not taking action.


-------------------------------
RESEARCH AND/OR MEMORIZE
-------------------------------

Align your interests with the interests of others. When you both stand to win from the
situation its easier to trust them, and to work together. For instance, a PM will want a good
property so its easier to rent and keep tenants in.



Fast Cash vs Wealth Building
---------------------------------
Taskrabbit - potential person to take pics of house OR handyman to fix issues...


Goals - Visualize them!!
-----------------------------
Spend a moment thinking of the positive side of reaching your goals - imagine it in depth with feelings etc

Spend a moment thinking of the negative side of not reaching your goals - this is actually more 
important, since pain is a far better motivator than pleasure.
