GAME PLAN
======================
Analyze every deal that comes thru email -
Add wholesaler to list if not already there




----------------------------
My WHY
----------------------------
Review this regularly!!

Its gonna be hard. When things are not going right, you need to find that spark or reason to 
keep perservering and pushing through. Remember your WHY!!

Pain of not having time with wife and family.
Pain of worrying about money.
Pain of being forced to work hard in a job with no end.
Pleasure of helping others around me.

Pain vs Pleasure
-------------------------------
Avoiding Pain/Fear is a FAR better motivator than Pleasure.
Its the pain or fear of being poor that will push you that extra mile a lot more than the 
potential pleasure for a great life 

When you are tired or uncomfortable its PAIN, or the fear and/or memory of 
PAIN that will drive you. 
Latch onto this - use it to your advantage!!

When you get stuck, lazy, or fearful, think of all the things you will lose by not taking action.
Really think deeply about it until you start to feel the pain that will occur by not taking action.


Goals - Visualize them!!
-----------------------------
Spend a moment thinking of the positive side of reaching your goals - imagine it in depth with feelings etc

Spend a moment thinking of the negative side of not reaching your goals - this is actually more 
important, since pain is a far better motivator than pleasure.


-------------------------------
RESEARCH AND/OR MEMORIZE
-------------------------------

Its not about who you know, its who knows you


The law of buoyancy.
"Theres something about this guy" At the end of the event everyone wants to know them.

When you meet someone - Why would THEY give you their time?
How do people feel when they are around you? Are you adding energy into the room?
What is your brand? What are you known for?

People may not remember you name, but they will remember how they feel around you?
Compliment them on the human side 


Try to give as much as you can - esp older people or others on the fringe - AOC??

FORM
Family, Occupation, Recreation, Motivation

Whale - slow moving - big, charity
Shark - Money, competitive, athletes, look good feel good smell good
Dolphin - travel and play, life of the party - ADD
Vahnas - A students, technical, skeptical





Dealer Status
------------------------
Dont become a real estate dealer (flips, speculation) - gray area, but if you do, then you:
-cant do 1031
-pay self emp tax
-no long term cap gains
-no depreciaion




Wyoming or Nevada LLC 
-----------------------
Keep Savings in the Wyoming/Nevada LLC
Create LLC in Indy, then have the Wyoming/Nevada LLC own the Indy LLC


Living Trust
------------------
Decides what to happen when people die - where the assets get divided



People who write things down take more action



Anderson Questions
-----------------------
Do we have to pay taxes in Indy for our rent? House in personal name
Do we have to pay taxes in Hawaii if our property is in an Indy LLC and we register as a foreign entity in Hawaii?

Cost to do the land trust vs quit claim?
Is the LLC that owns the land trust based in Hawaii or in Indy? Does that affect which state taxes are paid?

Rental Property
---------------------
Your rental start-up costs would be amortized on your Schedule E, not a Schedule C.  
Your start-up costs are accumulated until you become operational.  Expenses such as pre-operational 
acquisition costs, investigation costs, proof-of-concept costs are included in start-up costs.  
In the year you become operational you can deduct $5,000 of start-up costs with the balance spread over 
180 months beginning with the first month you are operational.  You would list this expense in your 
return as “Start-Up Expense Amortization.”

Improvements and betterments to your rental property, however, would be included in the depreciation 
base for this asset.  





2019
--------------

Lock up your money in your 401k - put it in something safe...
Take out your money from your 401k????



Ask Dad to roll over 401k into self-directed IRA???



1 M Nest Egg
9% passive = 90k a year, 7k a month passive






Creative way to Qualify for Hard Money
--------------------------
Put family/friends money in a bank account for 100k to season the money
Qualify for 1M???
Now you get access to 1M in hard money LOC???



Build up Commercial Credit and LOC???



C-Corp
------------------------------
Can write off bus expenses

Can do different types of businesses as long you have a strong enough operating agreement

Anderson does a 75 page operating agreement



Less likely to get audited as a C-Corp



Anderson has been doing taxes for 20 years, hasn't been audited in 7 years - also, they will represent you
