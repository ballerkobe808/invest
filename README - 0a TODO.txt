My WHY
----------------------------
Review this regularly!!

Its gonna be hard. When things are not going right, you need to find that spark or reason to 
keep perservering and pushing through. Remember your WHY!!

Pain of not having time with wife and family.
Pain of worrying about money.
Pain of being forced to work hard in a job with no end.
Pleasure of helping others around me.

Pain vs Pleasure
-------------------------------
Avoiding Pain/Fear is a FAR better motivator than Pleasure.
Its the pain or fear of being poor that will push you that extra mile a lot more than the 
potential pleasure for a great life 

When you are tired or uncomfortable its PAIN, or the fear and/or memory of 
PAIN that will drive you. 
Latch onto this - use it to your advantage!!

When you get stuck, lazy, or fearful, think of all the things you will lose by not taking action.
Really think deeply about it until you start to feel the pain that will occur by not taking action.


Goals - Visualize them!!
-----------------------------
Spend a moment thinking of the positive side of reaching your goals - imagine it in depth with feelings etc

Spend a moment thinking of the negative side of not reaching your goals - this is actually more 
important, since pain is a far better motivator than pleasure.


-------------------------------
RESEARCH AND/OR MEMORIZE
-------------------------------

Its not about who you know, its who knows you
