  Talking to the guy and hes gonna put me on the wholesaler list










GAME PLAN
======================
Spend one hour a day AT LEAST on RE

Analyze every deal that comes thru email -
Add wholesaler to list if not already there




----------------------------
My WHY
----------------------------
Review this regularly!!

Its gonna be hard. When things are not going right, you need to find that spark or reason to 
keep perservering and pushing through. Remember your WHY!!

Freedom to spend more time with wife and family.
Freedom from worrying about money.
Freedom from being forced to work hard in a job with no end.
Ability to help others around me.

RESEARCH AND/OR MEMORIZE
-------------------------------

flashing - the parts of the roof where there are edges/corners, there are diff types and places
where flashing will go...

fascia - the side of the roof where the roof ends - wood slats...
soffit - under the fascia


sheetrock - a brand of drywall - kind of like kleenex is a brand of tissue paper - 
use them interchangably for the most part

crown molding - fancy intricate layered moldings around the edges of your house
