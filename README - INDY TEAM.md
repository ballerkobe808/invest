Id love to connect. I was just in Hawaii for my honeymoon in September. I’ll be back in November as I’m funding a start up business with my brother in Maui.

Anyway, I run a full service investment brokerage in Indy for out of state investor clients and have a unique business model Id enjoy sharing with you. We source deals, provide rehab services, lease, property manage and sell properties for all of our investors. Whether you’re hands off or hands on, we can be your boots on the ground in Indy.
